# GearCashOut Human / Developer System Handbook

**Status:** Living document  
**Purpose:** Human-readable operating, developer and technical reference for GearCashOut / Action-Buyer UK.  
**Audience:** Gary, staff, administrators and future developers.  
**AI continuity companion:** docs/GEARCASHOUT-AI-OPERATING-MANUAL.md

> This document is intentionally a living system memory. It should be updated whenever a material workflow, database rule, integration or user-facing process changes. It is not a substitute for the source code or Supabase migrations; where they differ, the deployed code/database must be checked and this handbook corrected.

---

# 1. What GearCashOut Is

GearCashOut is a specialist equipment buying and valuation platform. A customer submits equipment for valuation, GearCashOut assesses it, an offer can be issued, the customer can accept or reject it, and accepted items move through a controlled purchasing, shipping, inspection, payment and completed-transaction workflow.

The system is supported by:

- a public/customer website;
- customer accounts;
- an internal administration area;
- a Quote Catalogue used to support valuations;
- a research/evidence system for catalogue pricing;
- Supabase for authentication, database logic and server-side functions;
- GitHub as the source-code repository;
- a separate Research PC running the local AI worker;
- Ollama with Gemma as the local research model.

The main repository is:

**wmdroneservices/Action-Buyer-UK**

---

# 2. High-Level Architecture

## The body
The public and administration website is primarily a GitHub-managed web application.

Key areas include:

- public pages and valuation entry;
- customer account pages;
- staff/admin pages;
- Quote Catalogue administration;
- AI Research Centre;
- purchasing and sales administration.

## The engine
Supabase provides the backend system of record and workflow logic.

It is responsible for areas including:

- authentication;
- customer and staff access;
- valuations;
- quote items;
- quote offers;
- catalogue products;
- AI research queues and candidates;
- live evidence;
- source registry;
- workflow RPC/functions.

## Amazon UK continuous research and verified comparison placement

When **Amazon UK Only** is selected and Continuous Catalogue Mode is started:

1. the continuous control stores `amazon_uk` as the research scope;
2. the local worker preserves that scope when it claims the next product;
3. discovery queries are restricted to actual Amazon UK URLs;
4. general retailer searches and approved-source fallbacks are disabled for that run;
5. results remain candidates until manually verified.

During manual review, the reviewer explicitly chooses the **Verified comparison bucket**:

- **NEW comparison — UK**
- **USED comparison — UK** (including refurbished comparisons)
- **OVERSEAS comparison**

Saving does not make evidence live. The reviewer must verify/edit it, accept it, and then explicitly apply it. The live application maps `new_uk` into the new comparison data and `used_uk` into the used comparison data.

## AI Research Queue Control

The AI queue is intentionally **not a permanent backlog**.

Operational rule:

- a new manual research run clears any older waiting jobs before adding the newly selected products;
- **CLEAR ALL QUEUED RESEARCH** removes all waiting jobs without interrupting the product currently being processed;
- stopping Continuous Catalogue Mode disables the continuous loop and clears waiting jobs, so old test products cannot continue into a later run;
- a product already physically being researched may finish safely unless the Research PC itself is stopped from the Remote Controls panel.

This prevents a testing sequence such as “run, stop, change filters, run again” from leaving older products hidden in the queue and processing later.

## The research brain
The Research PC runs a local Node.js worker and Ollama/Gemma.

Its job is to:

1. receive queued research work;
2. search approved and wider sources;
3. collect candidate evidence;
4. use Gemma to structure/filter findings;
5. send findings back to Supabase;
6. leave final acceptance to human review.

The local worker is in:

`tools/gear-ai-local-agent/agent.mjs`

The Research PC uses configuration outside the repository, including:

`C:\GearCashOut-Config\Start-GearCashOut-AI.ps1`

and configuration loaded from:

- `C:\GearCashOut-Config\.env`
- repository `.env`

The worker currently identifies itself in logs as Gary's GearCashOut Research PC and uses the configured Ollama model (recently Gemma).

# 3. Customer Journey: First Quote to Completed Sale

## Stage 1 — Customer submits equipment

The customer provides information about equipment they want GearCashOut to buy.

Depending on the product, the system may collect:

- manufacturer;
- model;
- specifications;
- condition;
- serial numbers/identifiers;
- usage information;
- photographs;
- accessories;
- drone-specific flight time;
- drone battery-cycle information;
- DJI binding/unbinding information where relevant.

The submitted equipment enters the valuation/quote workflow.

## Stage 2 — Valuation

The submitted item is associated with a valuation and quote items.

The Quote Catalogue and its market evidence support the valuation process, but catalogue research is not the same thing as automatically deciding a customer payout.

Staff can review information and produce an offer.

## Stage 3 — Offer issued

Offers are stored against quote items.

Customer-facing account logic can show:

- new quotes waiting for response;
- valuations received;
- valuation/sale updates;
- completed transactions.

Email functions are used for offer communications, including the `send-quote-email-v2` path.

## Stage 4 — Customer accepts or rejects

A published offer can be accepted by the customer.

The sale workflow includes database protection so that:

- only an available published offer can be accepted;
- the accepted offer is marked accepted;
- the relevant quote item is marked accepted;
- competing published offers for the same item can be superseded.

This is a controlled transition, not merely a front-end status change.

## Stage 5 — Purchasing and shipment

Accepted items move into the purchasing workflow.

The internal purchasing area is responsible for progressing the transaction through the operational stages rather than allowing a valuation to jump directly into payment.

The customer account can show progress and relevant shipping information.

## Stage 6 — Inspection and final valuation handling

After GearCashOut receives equipment, the operational workflow can assess whether the received item matches the agreed information.

The system has been designed to support outcomes including:

- acceptance and payment;
- changed/refused valuation handling;
- return flow where appropriate.

This distinction is important: receiving an item does not mean the system should automatically treat every valuation as finally paid without operational checks.

## Stage 7 — Payment

When the transaction reaches the appropriate payment stage, the customer account can show payment status, including payment sent/received states.

Bank/payment information is handled through the customer account and associated backend workflow.

## Stage 8 — Completed transaction

Paid transactions are archived into the completed-transaction area for customer records.

Eligible return options remain part of the broader operational design where applicable.

---

# 4. Quote Catalogue

The Quote Catalogue is a central internal valuation resource.

A catalogue product can have:

- manufacturer;
- model;
- package name/variant information;
- category/product type;
- active/customer-visible state;
- pricing/evidence information.

The catalogue is not simply a list of products. It is supported by evidence intended to explain and support market pricing.

Important principle:

**Evidence must not become customer-facing valuation truth merely because an AI found it.**

The system separates discovery, review and live application.

---

# 5. AI Research System

## 5.1 Purpose

The AI research system exists to expand and maintain market evidence for catalogue products.

It is designed to research:

- new UK retail evidence;
- used UK / marketplace evidence;
- overseas evidence;
- Amazon UK discovery.

## 5.2 Research scopes

The current dashboard supports:

- **All markets**
- **New UK retail**
- **Used UK / UK marketplace**
- **Overseas**
- **Amazon UK only**

The Amazon-only mode was added specifically because Amazon is a major comparison source but frequently blocks direct automated page retrieval.

## 5.3 Normal research flow

1. An administrator selects products and a research scope.
2. The website queues work through the Supabase AI research workflow.
3. The Research PC polls for work.
4. The Node worker performs searches and source checks.
5. Candidate pages/listings are collected.
6. Product identity and evidence are assessed.
7. Gemma helps structure/filter the findings.
8. Findings are stored as candidates.
9. A human reviews the candidates.
10. Accepted candidates remain separate until explicitly applied to live evidence.

## 5.4 Manual review is mandatory

The core rule is:

**AI research discovers and proposes. Humans decide.**

The system should not automatically publish uncertain evidence merely because a model found a plausible result.

This is especially important for:

- wrong variants;
- accessories instead of the main product;
- used items presented as new;
- missing prices;
- broken links;
- package differences;
- incorrect market/country classification.

---

# 6. Amazon UK Research

Amazon is a special case because direct automated access can be blocked.

The worker now treats Amazon UK as:

1. a mandatory discovery route during New UK research; and
2. a dedicated Amazon UK only research mode.

Amazon-focused searches include forms equivalent to:

- exact product + `site:amazon.co.uk`
- exact product + `Amazon UK`

If Amazon blocks direct retrieval but a search engine surfaces an exact-model Amazon result, the worker may preserve it as:

**Amazon UK indexed discovery**

This means:

- the discovery can reach manual review;
- no price is invented;
- availability is not invented;
- the human reviewer must verify the live listing;
- nothing is automatically accepted.

---

# 7. Evidence Review and Human Learning

The AI Research Centre uses a staged evidence process.

## Pending

The AI has found evidence but it has not yet been approved.

## Accepted

A human reviewer considers the finding suitable.

Acceptance alone does **not** immediately make it live.

## Rejected

A human reviewer considers the finding unsuitable.

## Apply Accepted to Live Evidence

This is a separate action.

Only accepted findings are eligible to be applied through the live-evidence workflow.

This separation protects the catalogue from accidental publication.

---

# 8. Review Reasons: Teaching the Research System

Review decisions can now include a reason.

The purpose is not merely record keeping. These reasons are intended to become structured feedback about what the human reviewer considers good or bad evidence.

Examples of rejection reasons:

- price missing;
- website/product link missing;
- link is broken;
- wrong model;
- wrong variant;
- accessory rather than the actual product;
- used item incorrectly classified as new.

Examples of accepted-with-correction reasons:

- accepted after correcting the price;
- accepted after replacing the source URL;
- accepted after correcting the condition;
- accepted after correcting the evidence category.

The long-term learning loop is:

**Gemma discovers → human reviews → human explains decision/correction → decision history becomes research guidance → future filtering improves.**

This is a central design principle for future development.

---

# 8A. Condition Rules for Comparison Evidence

GearCashOut does not operate a separate **Refurbished** buy-in category.

For comparison research:

| Listing condition | Evidence category | Condition retained |
|---|---|---|
| New | New UK | new |
| Used | Used UK | used |
| Open-box / returned stock | Used UK where appropriate | used/open-box |
| Refurbished / Renewed | Used UK | **refurbished** |

Refurbished/Renewed findings are **comparison evidence only**. They do not imply that GearCashOut buys refurbished stock.

The AI must preserve the distinction in the finding's condition so a reviewer can see that a price came from refurbished stock, while keeping the evidence within the existing Used comparison section.

---

# 9. Important Database / Workflow Separation

The system contains several distinct layers that must not be casually merged:

### Research candidate
AI-discovered information awaiting review.

### Accepted candidate
Human-approved research that is still not necessarily live.

### Live evidence
Evidence formally applied to the catalogue through the appropriate database workflow.

### Catalogue product
The product record itself.

### Customer valuation
A customer's submitted equipment valuation.

### Quote offer
An offer made to the customer.

### Purchase/sale workflow
The operational process after acceptance.

These are related, but they are not interchangeable objects.

---

# 10. Administration Areas

Known major administration areas include:

- AI Research Centre;
- Quote Catalogue;
- valuations;
- purchasing;
- staff management;
- customer/sales workflow.

The staff-management area supports creation and access control for staff accounts. Further documentation should record exact roles and permissions as the system is audited.

---

# 11. Customer Account

The customer account has distinct areas including:

- New Quotes;
- Valuations Received;
- Valuation Update;
- Completed Transactions.

Associated account modules include functionality for:

- sales/progress;
- bank details;
- bank summary;
- shipping links;
- returns;
- payment notifications;
- contact details.

The account is intended to be the customer's record of what is happening to their equipment through the transaction lifecycle.

---

# 12. Source Registry

The research system maintains a source registry.

Sources may be:

- known/approved research sources;
- newly discovered sources;
- blocked/rejected sources.

Automatic discovery is useful but must not be trusted blindly.

A key lesson from overnight testing was that automatic source and country classification can be wrong. Future development must distinguish:

- source domain;
- retailer's actual market;
- evidence market;
- currency;
- search scope that happened to discover the result.

These are not automatically the same thing.

---

# 13. Current Known Quality Problems

The following issues have been observed and must remain on the development memory:

## Weak product matches

Around 55% match confidence allowed unrelated products into review.

Examples included:

- one drone model returning other drone models;
- an Autel accessory returning DJI accessories;
- generic camera cages returning cages for unrelated equipment.

Future filtering should strongly favour exact model identity for pricing evidence.

## Market classification

Some used UK results appeared in New UK research, and UK domains appeared in Overseas results.

Classification must use actual listing/source evidence, not simply inherit the research pass.

## Source geography

Automatically discovered domains were sometimes assigned incorrect countries.

Country inference must be hardened.

## Amazon verification

Amazon discovery is now implemented, but its real-world performance must be tested from the newly updated Research PC installation.

---

# 14. Development Rules

When changing this system:

1. Inspect the existing workflow before changing it.
2. Do not replace working architecture with isolated shortcuts.
3. Preserve the separation between research, review and live evidence.
4. Protect customer workflow status transitions.
5. Prefer backend/database enforcement for important state changes.
6. Keep GitHub as the source-controlled record of code.
7. Document material changes in this handbook.
8. Record the reason for significant architectural decisions.
9. Do not assume a search result proves a product price.
10. Do not let AI findings bypass human review unless a future, explicitly designed rule permits it.

---

# 15. How Future Developers Should Work

A developer joining the project should begin by understanding the system in this order:

1. Read this handbook.
2. Inspect the repository structure.
3. Identify the relevant front-end page.
4. Identify the JavaScript controlling that page.
5. Identify the Supabase tables/functions involved.
6. Inspect relevant migrations.
7. Trace the customer/admin workflow before changing it.
8. Make the smallest safe change.
9. Test the complete affected workflow.
10. Update this handbook with the change and its reason.

---

# 16. The Living Memory Plan

This handbook is the persistent human-readable counterpart to working knowledge accumulated during development.

It should eventually contain:

## A. System overview
What GearCashOut does.

## B. Customer journey
From first quote to completed sale.

## C. Administration manual
How staff operate every major area.

## D. Technical architecture
Website → GitHub → Supabase → Edge Functions → Research PC → Ollama/Gemma.

## E. Database map
Main tables, relationships, statuses and critical RPC functions.

## F. Catalogue manual
How products, evidence and prices are managed.

## G. AI research manual
How the worker searches, filters, learns and submits candidates.

## H. Sales/purchasing manual
Accepted offer through receipt, inspection, payment, refusal and return.

## I. Staff and security manual
Accounts, permissions and protected areas.

## J. Change log and decision log
What changed, why it changed, and what problem it solved.

---

# 17. Current Development Direction

The current objective is to turn the accumulated system knowledge into two connected assets:

### 1. Developer/System Reference
Technical enough for someone maintaining the software.

### 2. Human User Handbook
Plain English instructions explaining how to operate the website and understand the business workflow.

Both documents should grow alongside the software.

**Rule for future work:** A material system change is not fully documented until this handbook and the relevant operational instructions have been updated.

---

## 17A. 5 September 2026 — AI research hardening pass

A live testing pass was carried out on the local Research PC after the worker, dashboard controls and source filters had been restored.

### What was observed

The tests confirmed that:

- the local PowerShell launcher can start the worker and the dashboard can see the Research PC;
- normal **All Sources** research can search multiple source types;
- Amazon-only mode required stronger defensive enforcement and clearer operational separation;
- related models and accessories could still consume search effort when product identity overlap was weak.

### Changes made

The local worker was tightened so that:

1. **Exact model identity is required** before a discovery result enters the evidence collection pool.
2. **Manufacturer identity is also required** when the catalogue product specifies a manufacturer.
3. Main-product searches reject common accessory/spare-part results unless the catalogue product itself is an accessory.
4. Recognised manufacturer bundles/combos/kits remain eligible.
5. **Amazon UK Only** remains a hard source boundary:
   - only Amazon-targeted queries are issued;
   - general web-market searches are not used;
   - approved-source/direct probes are disabled;
   - only actual `amazon.co.uk` result URLs can enter the pool;
   - the source-registry scope helper also refuses non-Amazon sources as a defensive fallback barrier.
6. A legitimate Amazon-only run may finish with zero findings rather than relaxing the source restriction.

### Operational rule

When testing a new source filter, first allow the currently processing product to finish or clear/stop the previous run as appropriate. The dashboard can change the next queued work while a product already claimed by the Research PC continues safely. Logs from that in-progress product therefore belong to its original run scope.

### Files changed in this hardening pass

- `tools/gear-ai-local-agent/agent.mjs`
- `tools/gear-ai-local-agent/README.md`
- `docs/GEARCASHOUT-SYSTEM-HANDBOOK.md`

This section is part of the persistent project record and should be read together with the AI research workflow rules above.

---

## 17C. 5 September 2026 — Simplified batch and continuous research control

The AI Research Centre originally displayed a separate Continuous Catalogue Mode panel with its own mode selector and Start/Stop buttons. This duplicated the main batch-selection decision and added unnecessary controls.

The interface was simplified so **Batch size** now contains:

- 1 product
- 3 products
- 5 products
- 10 products
- 25 products
- **Continuous**

The single **RUN RESEARCH** button now starts whichever mode is selected:

- a numbered value runs that batch;
- **Continuous** starts automatic catalogue continuation.

Switching back to a numbered batch and pressing **RUN RESEARCH** automatically ends continuous mode, clears waiting jobs, and starts the selected batch. This keeps the workflow in one place and removes the separate continuous-control panel.

---

## 17B. Research control buttons — clarified

The AI Research Centre uses different controls for different purposes. These must not be treated as interchangeable.

### CLEAR WAITING QUEUE

Removes only products that are still waiting to be claimed by the local worker.

It **does not interrupt a product already being researched**.

### STOP CONTINUOUS RESEARCH

Stops automatic catalogue continuation.

It is used only for Continuous Catalogue Mode and is **not** a general stop button.

### STOP ALL RESEARCH & WORKER

This is the full emergency stop.

It shuts down the local Research PC worker/launcher so the current processing loop cannot continue. The worker must be started again before new local research can run.

### START RESEARCH PC WORKER

Starts the local PowerShell/AI worker.

### RESTART RESEARCH PC WORKER

Stops and relaunches the local worker.

### Operational lesson

A batch can contain products already claimed by the worker and products still waiting in the queue. Clearing the queue only affects waiting products. If immediate interruption is required, use the full worker stop control.

The dashboard labels and confirmation messages were updated on 5 September 2026 to make this distinction explicit.

---

## Current baseline

This handbook records the system state and design direction as understood from the current repository and recent development work in September 2026. It should be expanded through a systematic repository and Supabase audit rather than relying indefinitely on conversational recollection alone.


---

## 17D. 5 September 2026 — Research PC emergency stop reliability fix

Live testing exposed two separate failures in the full-stop control.

### Root cause

The local worker created a detached PowerShell helper to walk up the process tree and terminate the outer launcher. The helper incorrectly used $pid as a normal variable. PowerShell treats $PID as a read-only automatic variable and variable names are case-insensitive, so the helper could fail before taskkill ran.

At the same time, the dashboard disabled the stop button and changed its label to **STOPPING ALL RESEARCH…** without a reliable completion/timeout path, so the button could remain permanently disabled.

### Fix

The emergency-stop workflow is now three-layered:

1. **Database stop:** Continuous mode is disabled and queued/claimed/processing research items are marked stopped so old work cannot resume later.
2. **Worker stop:** The local agent uses a corrected $currentPid process-tree traversal variable and falls back to terminating the Node process if no launcher shell is found.
3. **Dashboard confirmation:** The stop button now waits for command completion plus an offline heartbeat. It reaches a clear stopped state or releases itself after a timeout instead of remaining permanently on **STOPPING**.

The command registry now also accepts **START RESEARCH PC WORKER**, matching the existing dashboard button.

### User operation

- **STOP ALL RESEARCH & WORKER** means exactly that: stop the current run, clear active/waiting queue state, disable Continuous mode and shut down the local worker.
- When successful, the dashboard shows **RESEARCH PC STOPPED**.
- To resume later, use **START RESEARCH PC WORKER**.
- A numbered batch or Continuous research can then be started normally.

Because the Research PC is a manually downloaded/extracted copy rather than a live Git checkout, the local file that must be replaced for this fix is tools/gear-ai-local-agent/agent.mjs.

The dashboard/database changes are already source-controlled and database-enforced; the corrected local agent file is required before the physical PowerShell shutdown fix can take effect on the Research PC.


---

## 17E. Confirmed Research PC start/stop regression - 5 September 2026

### Existing design that must be preserved

The Research PC already uses:

Windows startup / desktop shortcut -> Start-GearCashOut-AI.ps1 -> npm start -> agent.mjs

The PowerShell launcher is expected to remain alive and restart the Node worker after an unexpected exit.

### Confirmed fault

A later repository change left Start-GearCashOut-AI.ps1 as a one-shot npm start launcher. Once Node exited, PowerShell exited as well.

Separately, the dashboard START control only writes a start_worker command into Supabase. That command can only be consumed by an already-running agent.mjs. It cannot wake a completely offline Windows process.

Therefore an offline Research PC could show a START confirmation but nothing happened after OK: the command was waiting for the very worker it was supposed to start.

### Correct behaviour

- The existing Windows startup/desktop launcher starts the PowerShell launcher.
- The PowerShell launcher remains alive and restarts npm start after 10 seconds if the worker exits.
- Remote STOP and RESTART commands are consumed while the worker is online.
- The dashboard must not claim that an offline worker has been remotely started when no persistent listener exists.

### Maintenance rule

Before changing Research PC controls, preserve this distinction:

Research queue control is cloud/database state. Research PC process control depends on a running local process.

Do not redesign the established startup chain without checking this handbook and the current local installation first.


---

## 17F. 5 September 2026 — Research PC launcher path fault and repair

### Fault confirmed from live PowerShell output

The desktop launcher successfully opened PowerShell, but PowerShell repeatedly reported:

`npm error path C:\\GearCashOut-Config\\package.json`

followed by an `ENOENT` package.json error and the launcher's automatic restart loop.

This established that Windows, the desktop shortcut and the restart loop were all functioning. The fault was the **working directory**: the PowerShell launcher lives in `C:\\GearCashOut-Config`, which is the permanent configuration folder, but the previous launcher treated its own folder as the Node project folder and therefore ran `npm start` in the wrong location.

### Correct architecture

`Desktop shortcut / Windows startup → C:\\GearCashOut-Config\\Start-GearCashOut-AI.ps1 → C:\\gearcashout\\Action-Buyer-UK-main\\tools\\gear-ai-local-agent → npm start → agent.mjs`

The configuration folder and the repository folder are deliberately separate:

- `C:\\GearCashOut-Config` holds persistent configuration and the external launcher.
- `C:\\gearcashout\\Action-Buyer-UK-main\\tools\\gear-ai-local-agent` holds `package.json`, `node_modules`, `agent.mjs` and the Node worker.

### Repair applied

The canonical PowerShell launcher was changed so it:

1. explicitly targets the extracted repository's agent folder instead of using `$PSScriptRoot` as the npm folder;
2. checks that `package.json` exists before running npm;
3. reports the exact configuration and agent folders in its startup log;
4. automatically runs `npm install` only when dependencies are missing;
5. preserves the established 10-second automatic restart loop;
6. supports an optional `GEARCASHOUT_AGENT_DIR` environment variable if the extracted repository is moved later.

### Local update required

For this repair, only the local PowerShell launcher file needs replacing:

`C:\\GearCashOut-Config\\Start-GearCashOut-AI.ps1`

Do **not** replace the permanent `.env` file. No full repository download is required for this specific repair.


---

## 17G. 5 September 2026 — Remote START fault: circular command architecture repaired

### Confirmed fault

The dashboard button **START RESEARCH PC WORKER** could not start a stopped worker. The frontend explicitly blocked the command when the worker heartbeat was offline, and the underlying architecture was circular: the worker itself was responsible for polling Supabase commands, so once stopped there was nothing alive to receive a START command.

### Repair: persistent Research PC supervisor

The Research PC now has two layers:

`PowerShell launcher → supervisor.mjs (always-on control channel) → agent.mjs (research worker)`

The supervisor remains alive when the research worker is stopped. It polls Supabase for lifecycle commands and can:

- START the research worker remotely;
- RESTART it remotely;
- STOP the research worker and emergency-stop research while retaining the control channel;
- answer status and Ollama checks.

### Dashboard status meanings

- **ONLINE** — supervisor and research worker are running.
- **READY** — supervisor is online but the worker is stopped; START can be used remotely.
- **OFFLINE** — the Research PC control channel itself is unavailable.

This removes the previous requirement to walk to the Research PC and manually start PowerShell after using STOP.

# 18. Documentation Architecture — Two Connected Manuals

GearCashOut now uses two separate but connected documentation layers. They must describe the same system truth, but serve different audiences.

## 18.1 Human / Developer System Handbook

This document remains the staff, administrator and developer-facing handbook and is the manual linked from the Staff Dashboard.

Its required structure is:

1. System overview and architecture
2. Authentication, staff access and permissions
3. Customer accounts
4. Quote and valuation system
5. Automatic valuation and pricing
6. Manual valuation and offer management
7. Customer acceptance, rejection and offer supersession
8. Purchasing, receipt, inspection, refusal and return workflow
9. Payment and completed transactions
10. Quote Catalogue
11. Evidence and market comparison data
12. AI Research Centre
13. Research PC, local worker and Ollama
14. Emails and notifications
15. Supabase architecture
16. GitHub/repository and deployment architecture
17. Troubleshooting, known faults and recovery
18. Change log and verification history

### Required traceability standard

For every major workflow, documentation must progressively provide this chain:

**User action → page → front-end controller → Supabase call → database object → trigger/function → status change → visible result.**

| Layer | What must be documented |
|---|---|
| User action | What the customer or staff member does |
| Page | Exact HTML/page entry point |
| Front end | Exact JavaScript/controller responsible |
| Backend call | Supabase RPC, query or Edge Function |
| Database | Tables/records read or written |
| Database logic | Functions, triggers, constraints and status rules |
| External services | Email, Ollama, Research PC or other integration |
| Result | What status changes and what the user sees |
| Verification | Proposed / Implemented / Tested / Verified Live |

This must be based on inspection of the actual deployed repository and Supabase objects. Documentation must not invent code paths.

## 18.2 AI Operating Manual / Persistent Project Memory

The AI manual is a separate technical continuity document:

docs/GEARCASHOUT-AI-OPERATING-MANUAL.md

Its purpose is to allow a future AI or developer AI to resume safely without rediscovering the project from scratch.

It records:

- current system architecture;
- authoritative sources of truth;
- current checkpoint and active work;
- non-negotiable rules;
- important architectural decisions;
- known faults and lessons;
- operational limitations and workarounds;
- verification status;
- documentation obligations after material changes.

The Supabase project-memory layer remains the structured persistent retrieval source. The repository AI manual is its human-readable companion.

## 18.3 Mandatory update rule

A material change to code, Supabase, workflow, integration or operational behaviour is not fully closed until the relevant documentation has been updated.

Where applicable, update:

1. this Human/Developer System Handbook;
2. the AI Operating Manual;
3. the Supabase project-memory event/checkpoint layer;
4. the verification status for the affected feature.

## 18.4 Current documentation build method

The manuals will be completed by auditing one system at a time rather than guessing at the entire architecture.

For each system:

1. inspect the live repository;
2. inspect the relevant Supabase tables/functions/triggers/RPCs/Edge Functions;
3. trace the complete workflow end to end;
4. document the exact connections;
5. test the workflow where practical;
6. mark the documentation with its verification state.

This handbook therefore becomes the living technical map for humans, while the AI Operating Manual and Supabase memory provide continuity for future AI work.


---

# 19. Developer Diagnostic Roadmaps

## Purpose

The Human / Developer System Handbook is not intended to duplicate the repository's source code.

Instead, every major visible website area and action should progressively receive a **Developer Diagnostic Roadmap**.

The purpose is to let a developer answer:

> **“This feature is not working. Where do I start checking?”**

The roadmap points to the relevant parts of the real system without copying large amounts of code into the manual.

## Required roadmap format

Each documented feature should contain:

### What the user does
The visible page, control or action.

### Expected result
What the user should see happen.

### Diagnostic route

**Website / Front end**
- relevant page;
- relevant JavaScript/module/component;
- relevant handler or function where known.

**Supabase**
- relevant table(s);
- relevant fields/status values;
- RPC/database function(s);
- trigger(s), RLS or permissions where relevant;
- Edge Function(s), where used.

**External / local systems**
- email service or email function;
- Research PC;
- local worker;
- Ollama;
- other integration where relevant.

### Failure checkpoints

A short ordered checklist showing where the action can fail.

### Expected data path

A simple roadmap such as:

User action
→ front-end handler
→ Supabase/API call
→ database record/function
→ external or local worker if applicable
→ status/result returned to website.

### Known issue history

Where relevant, link to or summarise:

- previous faults;
- fixes attempted;
- approaches that failed;
- current verified behaviour.

## Important rule

The roadmap must contain **real inspected paths and objects**. It must not invent filenames, tables or functions merely to complete a template.

If a feature has not yet been fully traced, it should be marked:

**Roadmap status: Not yet audited**

rather than guessing.

## Example

### Research & Pricing → Amazon UK Only

**User action:** Select Amazon UK Only and start research.

**Expected result:** Only Amazon UK research routes should be generated and accepted.

**Developer diagnostic route:**

1. Check the Research & Pricing source-filter front-end control.
2. Check the command/request created from that selection.
3. Check the Supabase record storing the selected research scope.
4. Check the local Research PC worker path in `tools/gear-ai-local-agent/agent.mjs`.
5. Check the source-routing logic before search queries are generated.
6. Check the final evidence/domain allowlist.
7. Check logs to identify the first point at which a non-Amazon route appears.

This is a diagnostic roadmap, not a copy of the code.

## Documentation rollout

Roadmaps will be added progressively as systems are inspected:

1. Quote and valuation flow
2. Customer acceptance/rejection
3. Purchasing, receipt, refusal and returns
4. Staff management and permissions
5. Quote Catalogue
6. Evidence and comparison pricing
7. AI Research Centre
8. Research PC and local worker
9. Email and notifications
10. Sales and completed transactions
11. Authentication and customer accounts

The eventual aim is that a developer can open the Human / Developer Handbook, identify the broken website area, and immediately see the route through the repository, Supabase and any connected services.

## 17C. 5 September 2026 — Amazon UK Only manual-run scope repair

### Fault observed

The dashboard could visibly select **Amazon UK Only** and the Edge Function received `evidence_scope = amazon_uk`, but the local Research PC still logged searches against Bright Tangerine, DJI Retail and other non-Amazon sources.

### First failure identified

The failure was in the Supabase RPC `ai_research_create_run_filtered(...)`.

**Path:**

1. `admin-ai-research.html` → Amazon UK Only control.
2. `admin-ai-research.js` → sends `evidence_scope: 'amazon_uk'`.
3. Supabase Edge Function `quote-catalog-ai-worker` → forwards `p_evidence_scope: evidenceScope`.
4. `ai_research_create_run_filtered(...)` → previously accepted the parameter but only preserved `new_uk`, `used_uk` and `overseas`; `amazon_uk` was incorrectly converted to `all`.
5. `quote_catalog_ai_research_runs.evidence_scope` therefore stored `all`.
6. `tools/gear-ai-local-agent/agent.mjs` correctly reads the stored run scope, so it legitimately searched all enabled sources.

### Repair

Supabase migration `supabase/migrations/20260905162500_fix_amazon_uk_manual_research_run_scope.sql` now preserves `amazon_uk` as a valid manual-run scope.

### Diagnostic lesson

For source-filter faults, do not stop at the front-end selection or request payload. Verify the persisted value in `quote_catalog_ai_research_runs.evidence_scope`.

The worker follows that database value. A correct UI label with an incorrect persisted run scope will still produce the wrong searches.

### Verification status

- Root cause: verified in live Supabase function definition.
- Database repair: applied.
- Repository migration: committed.
- End-to-end Research PC retest: required next.

# 20. AI Research Centre — Review Queue and Catalogue Comparison

**Roadmap status: Verified from current code and Supabase state on 5 September 2026.**

## What the staff user does

A staff user opens a proposed AI finding in **AI Research Centre**, checks the evidence page, edits the evidence if required, and can now use **COMPARE WITH CATALOGUE PRODUCT** to open the exact linked catalogue product.

## Expected result

### Pending review layout

Pending findings are no longer rendered as one permanently expanded list.

- **Amazon findings — review, edit and decide** contains Amazon findings separately.
- **Review, edit and decide** contains the remaining pending findings.
- Both sections are collapsed by default.
- Accepted, rejected and applied findings remain separate collapsible sections.

Amazon classification is based on the finding's effective source information, including the edited/original source URL and Amazon source text where available.

### Compare CTA

Each finding linked to a loaded catalogue product now includes:

**COMPARE WITH CATALOGUE PRODUCT**

The CTA opens:

`admin-catalog.html?product=<catalog_product_id>`

The catalogue page already reads the `product` URL parameter, loads the exact `quote_catalog_products` record, opens the editor and loads its associated `quote_catalog_retailer_prices` evidence rows.

## Developer diagnostic route

**User action**

AI finding → open finding → compare CTA.

**Front end**

1. `admin-ai-research.html` — AI Research Centre page and review styles.
2. `admin-ai-research.js` — `renderCandidateCard(c)`, pending grouping in `render()`, and `isAmazonFinding(c)`.
3. CTA target: `admin-catalog.html?product=<catalog_product_id>`.
4. `admin-catalog.js` — `load()` reads the requested product ID and `loadProduct(p)` opens the exact catalogue editor.

**Supabase**

- `quote_catalog_ai_candidates.catalog_product_id` links a finding to its catalogue product.
- `quote_catalog_products.id` is the target product.
- `quote_catalog_retailer_prices.catalog_product_id` supplies the existing comparison evidence shown in the catalogue editor.

## Expected data path

AI finding
→ `catalog_product_id`
→ compare CTA
→ `admin-catalog.html?product=...`
→ catalogue `load()`
→ matching `quote_catalog_products` record
→ `loadProduct()`
→ retailer/evidence rows loaded.

## Failure checkpoints

1. If the CTA is absent, check whether the finding has a resolvable `catalog_product_id` and the product was loaded into the review page.
2. If the CTA opens the catalogue but no product editor appears, check the URL `product` parameter and whether the ID exists in `quote_catalog_products`.
3. If the product opens but comparison rows are missing, inspect `quote_catalog_retailer_prices` for that `catalog_product_id`.
4. If an Amazon finding appears in the general queue, inspect its effective source URL/source fields first; do not classify by the dashboard filter alone.

## Change history

**5 September 2026 — Implemented**

- Added a separate collapsible Amazon findings review section.
- Made the general pending review queue collapsible.
- Added per-finding catalogue comparison CTA.
- Preserved the existing review/edit/accept/deny/apply workflow and existing evidence data model.

**Verification status:** Implemented and syntax-checked. Browser/live workflow verification is still required.

## AI Research Centre — Inline Catalogue Comparison

### Purpose

A reviewer can compare a proposed AI evidence finding against the current live catalogue evidence without leaving the AI Research Centre.

### User flow

1. Open a pending finding.
2. Click **COMPARE HERE WITH CATALOGUE**.
3. The finding remains open.
4. The page loads the linked product's current `quote_catalog_retailer_prices` records beside the new finding.
5. Review the new evidence and existing evidence side by side.
6. Either:
   - edit the new finding;
   - open the new evidence source;
   - open the full catalogue editor in a new tab;
   - close the comparison; or
   - click **ACCEPT & ADD TO LIVE EVIDENCE**.

### Data path

**User action**
AI Research Centre → finding → Compare Here With Catalogue

**Front-end**
`admin-ai-research.js`

**Existing catalogue evidence**
`quote_catalog_retailer_prices` filtered by `catalog_product_id`

**New evidence**
`quote_catalog_ai_candidates`

**Direct accept/apply path**
`quote_catalog_ai_candidates.decision = accepted` → `apply_accepted_ai_candidate(uuid)` → `quote_catalog_retailer_prices` → candidate receives `applied_at` and `applied_evidence_id`.

### Important rule

The inline vertical comparison does not automatically change a buying price. The reviewer must explicitly use **ACCEPT & ADD TO LIVE EVIDENCE** after comparing the evidence.

### Fallback navigation

The full catalogue editor remains available from the comparison panel and opens in a new tab, preserving the AI finding in the original tab.


### Inline comparison regression — 5 September 2026

**Observed behaviour:** Clicking **COMPARE HERE WITH CATALOGUE** appeared to close the review dropdown instead of showing the comparison.

**Root cause:** `admin-ai-research.js` correctly set the active comparison, but `render()` rebuilt the outer review `<details>` sections closed. The active finding was technically reopened inside a collapsed parent section.

**Repair:** `renderSection(...)` now keeps the parent decision section open whenever it contains the active comparison or active editor.

**Verification:** JavaScript syntax check passed. Live browser retest required.


---

# AI Evidence Review Feedback & Gemma Learning — 5 September 2026

## Purpose

Individual AI evidence decisions now capture structured human feedback so the local Gemma research workflow can learn why evidence was corrected, accepted or rejected.

## Data flow

**User action**  
Open individual AI finding → tick reviewed evidence areas → enter reason/correction note → manual Accept or Deny.

**Front end**  
`admin-ai-research.js`

- `manualReviewMarkup(...)` renders field checkboxes and reason input.
- `manualReviewAction(...)` calls `record_ai_candidate_manual_review(...)`.
- Direct individual acceptance can then call `apply_accepted_ai_candidate(uuid)`.
- Bulk Accept / Bulk Deny remain reason-free by design.

**Supabase**

- `quote_catalog_ai_candidates` — current decision and visible decision reason.
- `quote_catalog_ai_candidate_review_feedback` — immutable-style review audit with reviewed fields, changed fields, before/after snapshots, reason and reviewer.
- `quote_catalog_ai_learning` — structured learning summaries made available to the local AI worker.
- `record_ai_candidate_manual_review(uuid,text,text,jsonb)` — authoritative manual decision/feedback write path.
- `apply_accepted_ai_candidate(uuid)` — existing final live-evidence write path.

## Learning rule

Manual corrections are compared against the original candidate values. Changed fields are recorded automatically. The reviewer also explicitly ticks fields checked, such as:

- price;
- URL/exact product link;
- condition;
- product/model match;
- package/variant;
- evidence bucket;
- availability;
- source/retailer.

If a value was changed, the reviewer must explain why before manual acceptance. Manual denial always requires a reason.

## Bulk rule

Bulk Accept and Bulk Deny are deliberately separate from manual learning:

- no individual reason prompt;
- no field-by-field feedback;
- decision remains auditable on the candidate;
- Gemma should not infer a specific correction reason from a bulk decision.

## Diagnostic roadmap

If this workflow fails:

1. Confirm the button action in `admin-ai-research.js`.
2. Confirm the candidate ID and active review panel match.
3. Check `record_ai_candidate_manual_review(...)` exists in Supabase.
4. Check `quote_catalog_ai_candidate_review_feedback` for the audit row.
5. Check `quote_catalog_ai_candidates` for decision/reason/reviewer/timestamp.
6. Check `quote_catalog_ai_learning` for generated field learning.
7. For direct acceptance, then check `apply_accepted_ai_candidate(uuid)` and `quote_catalog_retailer_prices`.
8. Do not alter the existing apply function merely to repair feedback capture; identify the first failed step.

# AI Research Centre — Collapsible Discovery Lists and Current Startup Guide

## Discovery lists

The following large lists are intentionally collapsed by default:

- **New models and products found**
- **New websites and monitored launches**

Opening either section reveals the existing review controls and records. This is a usability change only: no product, source or approval workflow is automatically changed.

The source list retains:

- refresh;
- approve/block controls;
- monitored-opening status;
- source counts.

The product-discovery list retains:

- duplicate review;
- approve/reject;
- draft catalogue creation.

## Research PC setup, startup and restart instructions

The bottom-of-page guide was audited against the current Research PC architecture and corrected.

Current architecture:

**Windows desktop/startup launcher → C:\GearCashOut-Config\Start-GearCashOut-AI.ps1 → persistent supervisor.mjs → agent.mjs**

Important distinctions:

- **OFFLINE** means the Research PC supervisor/control channel is unavailable. Start the Windows launcher.
- **READY** means the supervisor is online but the research worker can be stopped.
- **ONLINE** means the research worker is active.
- **START RESEARCH PC WORKER** starts the worker through the persistent supervisor.
- **STOP ALL RESEARCH & WORKER** stops the worker/research but leaves the supervisor available for a later remote start.
- A normal Windows restart does not normally require `npm install`.
- `npm install` is needed after a fresh repository extraction or when dependencies are missing/changed.
- Do not run `npm start` from `C:\GearCashOut-Config`; it is a configuration folder and does not contain `package.json`.
- Permanent secrets remain in `C:\GearCashOut-Config\.env` and must not be overwritten by repository updates.


### Current comparison layout correction — 5 September 2026

The per-finding **COMPARE HERE WITH CATALOGUE** workflow is now deliberately vertical rather than two columns:

1. **NEW AI FINDING — EDITABLE** appears first.
2. The full finding editor is visible inside that comparison section, including price and exact product URL.
3. **CURRENT CATALOGUE EVIDENCE** appears directly underneath for comparison.
4. Saving the finding keeps the comparison open and refreshes the edited evidence.
5. The full catalogue editor remains available in a separate tab for deeper catalogue work.

This corrects the previous usability problem where the editor could render below a long comparison panel and appear not to open.


---

## 19. AI Research Review Audit Views — 5 September 2026

The AI Research Centre previously displayed a separate **Research Memory / Accepted and denied decisions** table. This duplicated information already available through the evidence review audit sections and made the page longer without adding a separate operational action.

The dashboard section was therefore removed.

This is a **UI simplification only**:

- accepted, rejected and applied evidence audit sections remain;
- individual manual review feedback remains recorded;
- structured Gemma learning remains stored in Supabase;
- `quote_catalog_ai_learning` is still used by the research workflow and has not been deleted or disabled.

The learning data is backend operational memory rather than a second on-page review queue.


### Full-width comparison correction — 5 September 2026

Live browser feedback showed that the comparison still appeared column-based because the normal expanded finding body remained visible above the comparison panel. That created a left catalogue-product column, centre evidence column and right action column before the vertical comparison.

The comparison state now replaces that normal multi-column finding body entirely.

When **COMPARE HERE WITH CATALOGUE** is active, the expanded finding shows one full-width workflow only:

1. **NEW AI FINDING — EDITABLE** as a full-width block across the page.
2. The editable fields immediately inside that block.
3. **CURRENT CATALOGUE EVIDENCE** as a second full-width block directly underneath.
4. Manual review feedback and accept/deny actions underneath.

The old three-column summary is not rendered while comparison mode is active.

The JavaScript asset version was also changed to force browsers to load the corrected implementation rather than continue using a cached script.


## AI Research Centre — Product-Centred Evidence Review (5 September 2026)

Pending AI evidence is now grouped by the linked `catalog_product_id` for review.

When a staff user opens a matched catalogue product, the page shows one complete review workflow in this order:

1. **NEW AI EVIDENCE — EDITABLE** — every pending finding for that product is displayed together in the same block, with each finding's full editable evidence fields and exact source link.
2. **CURRENT CATALOGUE EVIDENCE** — all existing `quote_catalog_retailer_prices` for the same product are loaded automatically underneath.

The reviewer no longer needs to open a separate comparison, click View Evidence, or move between pages to compare the matched product. Each evidence item can still be individually saved, submitted through `record_ai_candidate_manual_review(...)` and `apply_accepted_ai_candidate(...)`, or denied with a required reason for Gemma learning.

This preserves the existing separation between proposed evidence, manual acceptance and live evidence while changing the review UI from per-finding navigation to a product-centred evidence workspace.


### Grouped review panel close behaviour — 5 September 2026

The product-centred review uses native collapsible panels. A previous state-retention handler remembered the active product when it was opened but did not clear that state when the panel was closed. After a render, this could force the same review section back open and make it difficult to move to the next grouped review, including Amazon findings.

Current behaviour:

- opening a product loads its grouped new evidence and current catalogue evidence;
- closing that product review clears the active review state and keeps it closed;
- the reviewer can then collapse the surrounding section or open another product normally;
- opening another product switches the active grouped review without requiring an edit or decision;
- no Supabase schema or evidence workflow was changed.

This is a UI-state repair only. Save, submit and deny behaviour remains unchanged.


---

# AI Research Centre — Grouped Review Catalogue Context (5 September 2026)

## Purpose

A grouped AI review must show enough of the linked Quote Catalogue product to make a decision without repeatedly opening another page.

## Inspected data flow

**User action:** open a grouped catalogue-product review in admin-ai-research.html.

**Front end:** admin-ai-research.js → productReviewMarkup(group).

**Catalogue product data:** quote_catalog_products:

- manufacturer/model/package;
- category/product type;
- factory sealed price;
- opened-unused price;
- excellent price;
- good price;
- fair price;
- active/customer-visible/pricing metadata where loaded.

**Current evidence:** loadComparisonEvidence(productId) → quote_catalog_retailer_prices.

The grouped review now mirrors the useful Quote Catalogue context:

1. automatic buying-price ladder;
2. UK New evidence count;
3. lowest and highest qualifying UK New selling prices;
4. UK used/other reference count;
5. total current evidence count;
6. full current evidence table including retailer, type, condition, sell price, buy price, availability, buy method, region, exact source URL, notes and checked timestamp.

## Diagnostic rule

If a grouped review shows only the product name or incomplete catalogue context, inspect:

1. load() product field selection in admin-ai-research.js;
2. loadComparisonEvidence() field selection;
3. catalogueSnapshotMarkup() / productReviewMarkup();
4. the live quote_catalog_products row and linked quote_catalog_retailer_prices rows.

Do not reintroduce a separate evidence-view step when the required catalogue context can be shown directly in the grouped review.

### 5 September 2026 — Grouped AI review: full catalogue evidence classification
The grouped AI review snapshot must mirror the meaningful evidence context from the Quote Catalogue, not only rows that have both a GBP currency code and a UK region. The review now classifies every current quote_catalog_retailer_prices row into:

- UK NEW pricing evidence
- UK USED / OTHER evidence
- OVERSEAS comparison evidence
- Total current evidence records

The exact full evidence table remains underneath the summary, including retailer, type, condition, sell/buy prices, availability, region, exact source, notes and check time. Automatic buying prices remain separate and may legitimately show — where that catalogue product has not yet been priced.

This prevents a valid UK market row with a missing price_currency from being incorrectly shown as “no UK evidence”.


---

## AI Research Review — Full Current Evidence Comparison

The grouped product review is deliberately **product-centred**.

When staff open a matched catalogue product, the review must show the complete current catalogue context **before** the new AI findings so the reviewer can identify duplicates or already-recorded evidence without opening another page.

The current catalogue comparison block includes:

1. automatic buying prices:
   - factory sealed;
   - opened / unused;
   - excellent;
   - good;
   - fair;
2. evidence summary counts;
3. **UK — NEW PRICING EVIDENCE**;
4. **UK — USED / OTHER EVIDENCE**;
5. **OVERSEAS COMPARISON (NON-GBP)**.

Each evidence row exposes the catalogue evidence details needed for duplicate checking:

- retailer;
- evidence type;
- condition;
- selling price;
- buying price;
- availability;
- buy method;
- region;
- exact source URL;
- notes;
- checked date.

All new AI findings linked to that catalogue product remain grouped together underneath this complete current-evidence block.

The intended review order is therefore:

**Matched product → full current catalogue evidence → all new AI evidence → edit/review feedback → submit to catalogue or deny.**
\n---\n\n# Manual AI Review Outcomes — Right / Wrong / Adjusted\n\nThe individual AI evidence review now records a **per-field outcome**, not merely that a field was checked.\n\nFor each reviewed finding, staff can mark:\n\n- **PRICE** — AI WAS RIGHT / AI WAS WRONG / ADJUSTED\n- **PRODUCT / MODEL / PACKAGE MATCH** — AI WAS RIGHT / AI WAS WRONG / ADJUSTED\n- **EXACT URL / PRODUCT PAGE** — AI WAS RIGHT / AI WAS WRONG / ADJUSTED\n- **CONDITION** — AI WAS RIGHT / AI WAS WRONG / ADJUSTED\n- **AVAILABILITY** — AI WAS RIGHT / AI WAS WRONG / ADJUSTED\n- **SOURCE / RETAILER** — AI WAS RIGHT / AI WAS WRONG / ADJUSTED\n- **EVIDENCE CATEGORY** — AI WAS RIGHT / AI WAS WRONG / ADJUSTED\n\n**NOT CHECKED** remains the default.\n\n## Automatic correction capture\n\nThe existing candidate editor remains the place where staff change values. The review function compares original and edited values and automatically maps saved changes to the relevant review field as **ADJUSTED**.\n\nExamples:\n\n- price edited → `price: adjusted`;\n- exact URL edited → `url: adjusted`;\n- retailer/source edited → `source: adjusted`;\n- evidence category edited → `evidence_bucket: adjusted`;\n- title/package/variant/confidence edited → `product_match: adjusted`.\n\nThis prevents a correction from being lost merely because the reviewer forgot to select ADJUSTED.\n\n## Supabase storage\n\n`quote_catalog_ai_candidate_review_feedback.field_outcomes` stores the structured field outcome object.\n\nThe existing fields remain:\n\n- `reviewed_fields`;\n- `changed_fields`;\n- `before_values`;\n- `after_values`;\n- `review_reason`.\n\nThe live function remains `record_ai_candidate_manual_review(uuid,text,text,jsonb)`.\n\nThe fourth JSON argument now accepts either the legacy checked-field array or the new object form, for example:\n\n`{"price":"adjusted","url":"correct","source":"adjusted"}`\n\nFor Gemma learning, each outcome is written with the field, decision, outcome, reason and exact before/after values. Learning keys include the outcome so **correct**, **wrong** and **adjusted** feedback do not overwrite one another.\n\nThis feedback is recorded for both accepted and rejected individual findings. The existing `apply_accepted_ai_candidate(uuid)` path remains the authority for adding accepted evidence to the live catalogue.

---

## AI Evidence Review — Immediate Decision Movement and Inline Correction of Existing Evidence

The grouped AI evidence review now supports two additional workflow rules:

### 1. Manual submit/deny must visibly complete the workflow

When **SUBMIT TO CATALOGUE EVIDENCE** or **DENY WITH REASON** is pressed:

- the button immediately shows a processing state;
- the manual review is saved first;
- the queue is reloaded immediately afterwards;
- denied evidence leaves **Requires Attention** and appears in the denied/rejected audit area;
- accepted evidence leaves **Requires Attention**;
- if live application succeeds, it is applied to the catalogue evidence;
- if live application fails after the review itself was saved, the reviewer is explicitly told that the review moved out of Requires Attention but the live apply step failed.

The UI must never silently leave a reviewer uncertain whether a click was processed.

### 2. Existing catalogue evidence is editable inside the comparison

Each current catalogue evidence row now has an **EDIT** action inside the grouped review.

The reviewer can correct saved evidence without leaving the AI Research Centre, including:

- retailer;
- evidence type;
- condition;
- sell price;
- buy price;
- availability;
- buy method;
- evidence region;
- exact source URL;
- notes.

Saving updates the existing `quote_catalog_retailer_prices` row, refreshes the comparison cache, and redraws the grouped review so the new AI evidence is immediately compared against the corrected catalogue evidence.

No new evidence row is created by this correction workflow, and no automatic buying-price logic is changed.


### AI evidence review — verification links, full objective editing and immediate queue movement (5 September 2026)

The grouped AI evidence review is the working comparison surface for existing catalogue evidence and new AI findings.

Current rules:

- every current catalogue evidence row exposes an **OPEN / VERIFY** source link;
- the exact saved source URL remains visible and directly clickable;
- existing evidence can be edited in place without leaving the AI Research Centre;
- editable objective fields include retailer, type, condition, sell price, buy price, currency, original selling price, VAT basis, VAT rate, availability, buy method, evidence region, exact source URL, checked timestamp and notes;
- overseas/non-GBP evidence displays its stored currency rather than being misleadingly shown as GBP;
- **DENY WITH REASON** saves the decision first and immediately removes the finding from Requires Attention into Denied;
- **SUBMIT TO CATALOGUE EVIDENCE** saves acceptance first and immediately removes the finding from Requires Attention before the live apply step runs;
- if live application fails, the accepted review remains accepted and the UI reports that only the apply step failed;
- an inline processing/status message is shown so a reviewer is not left unsure whether a click worked.

Data flow remains:

`quote_catalog_ai_candidates` → `record_ai_candidate_manual_review(...)` → Accepted/Rejected audit state → optional `apply_accepted_ai_candidate(...)` → `quote_catalog_retailer_prices`.

No automatic buying-price logic was changed.

## AI Research Centre — Grouped Review Panel Collapse Diagnostic Roadmap

### User action
Open or close a matched catalogue-product review in **AI Research Centre → Review, edit and decide**.

### Front-end entry point
- `admin-ai-research.html`
- Native `<details class="ai-product-review-details">` grouped review panel.

### Controller and state
- `admin-ai-research.js`
- `activeProductReviewId`
- `openProductReview(productId)`
- document `toggle` handler for `.ai-product-review-details`
- `comparisonEvidenceByProduct` cache.

### Expected data flow
1. Opening a native details panel records the active product review.
2. Current catalogue evidence is loaded from `quote_catalog_retailer_prices` for the linked catalogue product when not already cached.
3. The panel remains open naturally while evidence loads.
4. A render after loading is allowed only if the same review is still active.
5. Closing the panel clears `activeProductReviewId`.
6. A delayed evidence load must not recreate a panel as open after the reviewer has closed it.

### Failure point / known fix history
A previous implementation called `render()` immediately during the native details opening transition and again after the asynchronous evidence load. That could race with the browser's close state and make grouped reviews appear impossible to collapse. The repair removes the synchronous opening render and guards the post-load render with the current active review ID.

### Backend impact
No Supabase schema or workflow change. The existing evidence source remains:

- `quote_catalog_retailer_prices`

The repair is UI state handling only; it must not alter manual review, deny, accept or live-evidence application workflows.

## 5 September 2026 — Freefly Astro Official Evidence Audit

The official Freefly Astro collection was checked against the current Quote Catalogue after a pending AI candidate used a generic third-party review URL with a $27,000 price.

### Corrections made

- refreshed current official USD evidence for Astro Max, Astro Max NDAA/Blue, Mapping Essentials NDAA/Blue, Flux L1/O1/H1 and LR1 Payload;
- added the missing **Freefly Astro Max Mapping Essentials** standard bundle at **$37,725 USD**;
- corrected the **Astro Max NDAA/Blue with LR1** configuration from an incorrect $37,725 reference to the official **$43,725 USD** NDAA Mapping Essentials price;
- removed an unrelated Canon UK £6,999.99 manufacturer RRP from the legacy Freefly Astro record because the official current collection does not publish a standalone legacy Astro price;
- added active structured learning for Gemma: a generic category, collection, review article or broad model page must not be treated as exact price evidence unless the exact catalogue product and displayed price are directly matched.

The generic pending AI candidate was intentionally left in the human review queue so the reviewer can deny it through the normal feedback workflow and add the specific review reason.


### 5 September 2026 — Inline decision processing status repair

The grouped AI evidence review's manualReviewAction(...) already changed the clicked button label and wrote a page-level result message, but the review markup did not actually contain the .ai-manual-review-status element that the action code was trying to update.

A dedicated inline live-status region now exists inside every manual review panel. It reports the actual transition in place:

- saving review decision and moving out of Requires Attention;
- saving denial and moving to Denied;
- any returned error.

The existing Supabase decision and application authorities are unchanged:

record_ai_candidate_manual_review(...) → decision transition, then optional apply_accepted_ai_candidate(uuid).


---

## MPB UK evidence rule and audit — 5 September 2026

### Source-specific evidence rule

MPB category pages and brand pages are **discovery pages**, not final exact-price evidence.

Required route:

Catalogue product
→ MPB category/brand discovery if useful
→ exact MPB `/en-uk/product/...` model page
→ inspect every live individual unit
→ store each relevant unit separately.

MPB model pages can expose multiple live units with separate:

- SKU;
- selling price;
- cosmetic condition;
- charges where shown;
- included accessories/controller/package details.

These must not be collapsed into one representative price.

### Audit finding

The existing database contained **1,743 MPB evidence rows**:

- 759 exact MPB product-page rows;
- 404 category-page rows;
- 465 brand-page rows.

Across 1,176 products with MPB evidence:

- 549 had **only generic MPB evidence** and no exact product-page evidence;
- 352 had only one exact MPB row;
- 109 had multiple exact MPB rows;
- 629 products contained at least one generic MPB row.

Generic category/brand evidence is therefore not reliable enough to treat as final exact product evidence and requires replacement through exact MPB model-page auditing.

### Verified example — DJI Mavic 3

The exact current MPB Mavic 3 page exposed multiple live used units. Under the current design, these are aggregated into one reference-only From → To range with a direct verification link instead of separate SKU evidence rows.

The generic/category evidence was removed. The current MPB design now represents an exact MPB product page as one reference-only From → To range with conditions represented and a direct verification link, rather than persisting one evidence row per SKU.

**Verification source:** exact MPB Mavic 3 model page.


### MPB UK audit architecture repair — 5 September 2026

The MPB sweep exposed two additional first-failure points that had to be corrected before a historical audit could be trusted:

1. **MPB UK was not present in the active AI source registry**, so the local worker could not deliberately probe MPB as a UK used-market source.
2. **The generic candidate model treated one URL as one observation**, but an exact MPB model page can contain many live SKUs.

MPB UK is now registered as an enabled used_dealer source with used_uk scope and priority 5.

Worker version 1.4.7 adds deterministic MPB UK extraction from exact /en-uk/product/... pages. Each live SKU becomes a separate evidence candidate with its own price, cosmetic condition and charges/shutter metric where present.

The evidence table's uniqueness rule also required SKU-level source identity because two genuine MPB units can share the same condition and price. MPB unit URLs therefore use a #mpb-sku-... fragment while retaining the canonical model URL in notes.

A dedicated roadmap now exists at:

docs/MPB-UK-EVIDENCE-AUDIT-DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAP.md

Live verification also refreshed:

- DJI Air 3 Standard Package (DJI RC-N2): one exact live MPB unit at £584.
- DJI Mini 4 Pro Standard Package: four exact live MPB units from £444 to £639.

The generic-only audit count moved from 549 to **547**.

The historical sweep remains in progress; it must not be marked complete until every remaining generic-only product has an exact, out-of-stock, not-stocked, or explicit package-mismatch outcome.


### Deep Source / Website Audit — 5 September 2026

A new research mode was added because normal source searching can find a category or landing page without proving that the exact product was searched deeply enough.

Deep Source Audit works from a user-entered landing page but treats that page as discovery-only.

Flow:

landing page
→ relevant categories
→ relevant subcategories
→ source-specific internal search where available
→ exact product page
→ evidence extraction.

Supabase runs now support:

- evidence_scope: deep_source
- deep_source_url
- deep_source_domain

The Deep Source run uses the existing secure research queue and Research PC rather than creating a second worker system.

The Edge Function quote-catalog-ai-worker was deployed as version 8 to create Deep Source runs.

Repository worker version is now 1.4.8. The Research PC must be updated from 1.4.7 before live Deep Source work begins.

Current explicit source rules include MPB UK and a DJI framework rule. MPB exact pages remain deterministic: every live SKU is preserved separately.

Category, manufacturer, brand and search pages are discovery-only and must never be accepted as final product price evidence.


### Catalogue-centred Pending AI Evidence Review — 5 September 2026

Pending AI findings now have a first-class review surface inside `admin-catalog.html`.

The live/pending separation is unchanged:

- `quote_catalog_ai_candidates` with `decision='pending'` = proposed evidence only.
- `quote_catalog_retailer_prices` = verified live catalogue evidence.

Pending evidence is displayed beside the relevant product under a prominent red **P** and **PENDING EVIDENCE — NOT LIVE** heading. It is grouped into:

- UK — NEW
- UK — USED / OTHER
- OVERSEAS

The main catalogue has a top warning bar showing total pending evidence and affected products, grouped by manufacturer with a product dropdown. Product cards with pending findings receive a red PENDING badge.

Review flow:

1. Verify/edit the proposed evidence on the catalogue product.
2. Record field-by-field outcomes and a reason when denying or correcting.
3. Accept → `record_ai_candidate_manual_review` → `apply_accepted_ai_candidate` → live evidence row.
4. Deny → candidate becomes rejected; existing live catalogue remains unchanged.

Pending evidence cannot affect live comparison or automatic pricing before approval.

Implementation file:

- `admin-catalog-pending-ai-review.js`


## 6 September 2026 — MPB used-market reference ranges

MPB UK is now treated as **Used / Other Evidence — Reference Only**. The exact MPB product page is the evidence identity. Multiple live units on that page are aggregated into one pending range: **From price**, **To price**, conditions represented and units observed. The direct canonical MPB product URL is retained so staff can verify the latest stock and manually refresh stale evidence. MPB evidence does not alter automatic buying prices.


---

# 6 September 2026 — AI Research Completed-Decision Audit Simplification

The active **Review, edit and decide** evidence area in the AI Research Centre is no longer the primary review workspace.

Current routing:

- pending evidence remains in Supabase and is reviewed from the **Automatic Quote Catalogue**;
- **Rejected findings** remain visible in the AI Research Centre for audit and Gemma learning;
- successful accepted findings appear in **Applied to live evidence**;
- an accepted finding that cannot be applied is retained in a visible **Live application issues** recovery section so an application failure cannot disappear silently.

No database schema, RLS, review-feedback RPC or live-evidence application RPC was changed.


### Deep Source landing-page history — 6 September 2026

The AI Research Centre's **Deep Source / Website Audit** now keeps a persistent dropdown history of recently entered valid landing-page URLs on the staff device/browser. A new valid URL is normalised and saved, duplicates are de-duplicated, and the most recent entry is shown first. The history is capped at 20 URLs.

The saved history does not replace the run configuration: the currently selected/entered URL remains the explicit `deep_source_url` sent to the Deep Source workflow.


## Deep Source Audit source isolation and website registry suggestions — 6 September 2026

### Data flow
admin-ai-research.html Deep Source URL field
→ admin-ai-research.js registry + local-history datalist
→ quote_catalog_ai_sources.homepage_url for approved enabled live website suggestions
→ quote-catalog-ai-worker with evidence_scope=deep_source and explicit deep_source_url
→ ai_research_create_deep_source_run(...)
→ quote_catalog_ai_research_runs.deep_source_url/deep_source_domain
→ Research PC collectDeepSourceEvidence(...).

The normal source selector (all versus amazon_uk) is not included in the Deep Source request and does not alter the Deep Source execution branch.

Failure point to remember: the normal Amazon scope previously widened to all because of an RPC persistence bug. That history applies to normal research runs, not Deep Source runs; the Deep Source path has its own explicit branch and run contract.


---

## 6 September 2026 — AI Research Centre control separation

The AI Research Centre has two execution paths which share product-identification filters but do not share source scope or batch controls.

### Shared: Products to research

The following filters identify which catalogue products either workflow should process:

- Manufacturer
- Model / search term
- Category
- Product type

### Regular AI Research only

Regular research uses:

- Market / condition selection;
- All Sources / Amazon UK Only;
- Regular research batch size;
- Continuous mode.

### Deep Source Website Audit only

Deep Source uses:

- the selected website landing page;
- its own Deep Source audit batch size;
- the explicit Deep Source domain as the source scope.

The normal market and source selectors do not broaden a Deep Source audit.

### Important UI rule

There must be no ambiguous duplicate batch-size control. The dashboard keeps:

- **Regular research batch size** for normal AI research;
- **Deep Source audit batch size** for the selected website audit.

Both workflows reuse the shared product filters, so staff select the products once and then choose which research action to run.


## Deep Source Audit live-state and targeted cancellation — 6 September 2026

### Dashboard behaviour
admin-ai-research.js polls the current Deep Source runs and their queue rows. A run is treated as active when its run status is queued/running or any queue row is queued, claimed or processing. The UI shows live progress on RUN DEEP SOURCE AUDIT and reveals CANCEL DEEP SOURCE AUDIT.

### Targeted cancellation data flow
CANCEL DEEP SOURCE AUDIT
→ admin-ai-research.js
→ ai_research_cancel_run(p_run_id)
→ active queue rows for that run become skipped
→ run becomes cancelled
→ Research PC and unrelated research continue.

The completion RPC now only completes queue rows still in processing or claimed, so cancelled/skipped rows cannot be overwritten by a late worker completion. The Research PC worker also checks the persisted run state before writing candidates and exits the current item cleanly when the run has been cancelled.

### Failure point to check first
If the dashboard says an audit is running after completion, inspect quote_catalog_ai_research_runs and quote_catalog_ai_queue for the run. Queue state is authoritative for live activity because the current worker can leave the run record as queued while it processes individual items.


## Pending evidence source-page verification shortcuts — 6 September 2026

The catalogue-centred pending AI evidence review now places an **OPEN SOURCE PAGE** shortcut directly beside the verification fields where the reviewer needs the underlying page most often:

- FROM / TO PRICE RANGE;
- PRODUCT / MODEL / PACKAGE;
- EXACT PRODUCT PAGE URL.

The same exact source URL is also accompanied by an **OPEN / VERIFY PAGE** shortcut in the editable evidence fields. These links open the candidate's canonical `source_url` in a new tab and do not alter the candidate, review outcome, acceptance flow or live evidence.

The existing bottom action remains as a general source-page shortcut, renamed **OPEN / VERIFY SOURCE PAGE** so it is not MPB-specific.


## Pending evidence review — Check All confirmation — 6 September 2026

Where a reviewer has verified that every field in a pending evidence finding is correct, the **VERIFY EACH FIELD** panel now includes **CHECK ALL — AI WAS RIGHT**.

Checking it marks all seven field outcomes as **AI WAS RIGHT** in one action:

- price range;
- product / model / package;
- exact product page URL;
- conditions represented;
- availability;
- source / retailer;
- evidence category.

If any individual field is subsequently changed, the bulk checkbox automatically reflects that the whole set is no longer unanimously marked correct. This is only a review-input shortcut: nothing is written to the candidate or live catalogue until the normal **ACCEPT & ADD TO CATALOGUE** action completes.


---

## 6 September 2026 — Valid evidence routing and catalogue reassignment

### Decision

A model or package mismatch must no longer cause otherwise valid research to be discarded.

The research pipeline now treats a mismatch as a **review and routing condition**:

1. the candidate remains pending;
2. the original mismatch state is preserved for human review;
3. staff can select the correct catalogue product;
4. the candidate is reassigned without recreating or re-researching the source;
5. source URL, title, price/range, condition, availability, notes and timestamps remain on the same candidate record;
6. an audit row records the original and destination catalogue product.

### Diagnostic route

**Pending catalogue evidence card**
→ `admin-catalog-ai-evidence-reassignment.js`
→ `reassign_ai_candidate(...)`
→ `quote_catalog_ai_candidates.catalog_product_id`
→ `quote_catalog_ai_candidate_reassignments`
→ candidate appears under the correct catalogue product for normal verification and acceptance.

### Database change

`ai_research_submit_candidate(...)` now permits valid `package_match='mismatch'` or `variant_match='mismatch'` findings to enter the pending review queue. This is intentional: mismatch is no longer a data-loss rule.

### Safety

Reassignment is limited to pending, unapplied candidates and requires staff access. Applied evidence cannot be silently moved.


### 2026-09-06 UI clarification fix — marking a wrong target

The pending-review **VERIFY EACH FIELD → PRODUCT / MODEL / PACKAGE → AI WAS WRONG** control is now a direct trigger for the reassignment workflow. Selecting it immediately reveals the **VALID EVIDENCE — WRONG TARGET DETECTED** panel and destination-product selector. Package Match or Variant Match = Mismatch also triggers the same panel. This avoids requiring staff to understand that the verification outcome and package/variant metadata were previously separate controls.

### 2026-09-06 searchable reassignment catalogue selector

The **VALID EVIDENCE — WRONG TARGET DETECTED** reassignment control now includes keyword search across all active catalogue products. Staff can search by manufacturer, model, package name, package key, or other matching keywords before selecting the destination product. The destination list is no longer restricted to the currently targeted manufacturer, preventing valid evidence from becoming trapped when the wrong manufacturer/model/package was initially identified.

## 6 September 2026 — Deep Source identity-depth correction

The MPB screenshots exposed that the worker was discovering the correct deep exact product URLs, but its search identity was still too broad in two ways:

1. Deep Source only used the first/base product search name for internal and external discovery, so a specific package/kit identity could be ignored.
2. Exact-model validation allowed the full page body to prove the model. On MPB, “You might also like” and “Similar products” sections can mention another model/package, creating a false positive even when the page title and canonical URL describe a different product.

Worker **1.5.2** now:

- runs every real catalogue search identity from productSearchNames(...), including specific package/kit names;
- derives MPB direct exact-page URLs for each identity, not only the base model;
- repeats MPB web discovery and source-specific internal search for each identity;
- validates Deep Source identity from the page title and canonical product URL rather than related-product text;
- marks valid same-model evidence with a package mismatch as **VALID EVIDENCE — WRONG TARGET / PACKAGE DETECTED** instead of silently treating it as an exact match.

This keeps the existing preservation/reassignment workflow intact while making the crawler more specific and deeper for named packages and kits.


## Mavic 2 MPB package taxonomy correction — 2026-09-06

The Mavic 2 catalogue must follow evidence at the **exact product/package level**, not collapse MPB's separate product pages into one generic model.

### Current catalogue structure

**DJI Mavic 2 Pro**
- Standard Package
- Fly More Combo
- With DJI Smart Controller
- Fly More Combo with Smart Controller

**DJI Mavic 2 Zoom**
- With RC1 Controller (the former generic Standard Package row was corrected to this exact MPB identity)
- Fly More Combo
- With Smart Controller

**Separate accessories, not drone packages**
- DJI Mavic 2 Zoom ND Filter Kit
- DJI Mavic 2 Pro ND Filters Set

### Evidence routing rule

An aircraft page, controller package, Fly More bundle, or filter kit must never share evidence merely because the base model text is similar. Route evidence to the exact catalogue identity. Filter kits are independent accessory products and must not influence drone-package valuation.

The customer valuation wizard reads active package variants from `quote_catalog_products`. Legacy Mavic 2 battery/package compatibility maps were updated to recognise RC1, Smart Controller and Fly More + Smart Controller variants.


## 6 September 2026 — Deep Source filtering and missing catalogue identities

Deep Source filtering now distinguishes a broad model family from the exact source identity. A generic catalogue package such as **Standard Package** is no longer treated as an exact match merely because the base model appears in the page title.

For an exact same-model source page with a distinct identity (controller, Fly More/Combo, bundle, kit, filter/lens or other accessory), the worker:

1. marks the finding as a preserved wrong-target/package identity;
2. keeps the exact source URL and evidence for staff review;
3. creates a pending **NEW PRODUCT CANDIDATE** where that exact identity is not represented by the current catalogue;
4. never auto-adds or activates the discovered product.

This separates two jobs that must not be conflated:

- **evidence filtering** — do not attach RC1/Smart Controller/kit prices to a generic Standard Package; and
- **catalogue discovery** — surface missing exact packages and accessories for approval.

Research PC worker version: **1.5.3**.


---

## 6 September 2026 — Mavic 3 exact-package correction and evidence reassignment

A review of the DJI Mavic 3 MPB Deep Source findings confirmed the same failure pattern previously seen in the Mavic 2 family: broad family matching had allowed distinct MPB model/package pages to accumulate under **DJI Mavic 3 — Standard Package**.

The catalogue and evidence were corrected using the exact MPB product-page identity, not the family name alone.

### Exact identities added or separated

- Mavic 3 Enterprise — With RC Pro Enterprise Controller
- Mavic 3 Pro Cine — Premium Combo with RC Pro Controller
- Mavic 3 Classic — Fly More Combo
- Mavic 3 Pro — Fly More Combo
- Mavic 3 Pro — Standard Package

Existing exact catalogue rows were also used for:

- Mavic 3 — Standard Package
- Mavic 3 — Fly More Combo
- Mavic 3 — Cine Premium Combo
- Mavic 3 Classic — Standard Package
- Mavic 3 Intelligent Flight Battery

The MPB Mavic 3 Enterprise reference evidence was moved from the generic Enterprise Standard Package to the exact RC Pro Enterprise Controller package.

All Mavic 2/Mavic 3 findings from the reviewed batch were cleared from **pending**. Exact findings were applied to the matching catalogue identity; one duplicate discovery of the same exact Mavic 3 MPB page was retained as rejected audit history rather than creating duplicate live evidence.

### Permanent matching rule reinforced

For package-heavy families, the worker must treat these as separate identities when the exact source page says so:

- base model;
- controller-specific package;
- Fly More/Combo package;
- Cine/Premium package;
- Classic/Pro/Enterprise variant;
- battery, filter, lens or other accessory.

A family-name match alone is not sufficient to place evidence into a Standard Package.

When the exact identity is already in the catalogue, route evidence there. When it is not, preserve the evidence and surface a new-product candidate/reassignment path. Do not force the evidence into a generic package and do not discard it.


---

## 20. 6 September 2026 — DJI package identity normalisation

A live Gemma/MPB regression test exposed that generic **Standard Package** records were too ambiguous for DJI products. A used MPB result titled **DJI Mini 2 with RC-N1 Controller** correctly identified the model but could only be matched against the catalogue's generic **Mini 2 — Standard Package** identity.

### Rule adopted

For DJI drones, a Standard Package should represent a real base package identity, not an undefined aircraft family. Where the controller is part of the identifiable base package, the catalogue package name must include that controller.

Initial MPB-backed normalisation completed:

- Air 2 → **Standard Package (DJI RC-N1)**
- Air 2S → **Standard Package (DJI RC-N1)**
- Mavic Air → **Standard Package (Mavic Air Controller)**
- Mini 2 → **Standard Package (DJI RC-N1)**
- Mini 4K → **Standard Package (DJI RC-N1)**

The Mini 2 pending MPB candidate remains attached to the same product record and now has a precise package identity instead of relying on the generic word “Standard”.

### Important limitation discovered

Not every DJI model has one unique controller identity in used-market listings. MPB can group several controller configurations under one model page, particularly in the Mavic 3 family. Those products must not be blindly renamed to a single controller configuration. They require either separate controller/package records or explicit human reassignment rules.

### Next verification

Run broader DJI research and check:

1. whether exact controller/package wording improves Gemma matching;
2. whether Fly More and controller variants remain distinct;
3. whether generic model pages containing mixed controller configurations are kept in review;
4. whether ambiguous generic Standard Package records should be split or retired rather than renamed.


## 6 September 2026 — Large and whole-manufacturer Deep Source audits

The previous **25-product UI ceiling** was not a crawler limitation. It came from the Deep Source dashboard options and an Edge Function clamp. The database RPC separately capped positive requests at 100, creating inconsistent limits across the execution path.

Deep Source now supports:

- 1, 3, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250 or 500 products; and
- **ALL matching products**.

For safety, ALL matching products requires at least one shared product filter. Selecting a manufacturer therefore provides the intended **whole manufacturer audit** without accidentally queuing the entire catalogue.

The RPC treats `p_limit <= 0` as no SQL limit while retaining the existing manufacturer/model/category/product-type filters. Positive Deep Source limits are capped at 500 by the Edge Function. Regular AI Research retains its existing separate batch behaviour.


## 6 September 2026 — Match-status contract repair (worker 1.5.4)

### Failure identified
The live Supabase RPC ai_research_submit_candidate accepts only four package/variant status values: exact, compatible, uncertain, mismatch.

The DJI Deep Source run exposed a producer-path inconsistency: Deep Source identity code could emit match, while the database contract rejects that value as Invalid match status.

### Repair
Worker 1.5.4 introduces one canonical status boundary. Every package/variant status is normalised immediately before RPC submission. The Deep Source exact-identity producer now emits exact directly rather than match.

This is deliberately a worker-side compatibility repair. The database contract remains strict so invalid future producer values cannot silently enter the catalogue.

### Required verification
After the Research PC reports worker 1.5.4, run a small controlled Deep Source test before another large manufacturer audit. Confirm that valid exact MPB candidates no longer fail with Invalid match status.


---

## Phase 2 — Retail Storefront Foundation — 6 September 2026

GearCashOut now has an additive backend foundation for a separate branded retail storefront while preserving the existing multi-channel sales system.

### Architecture decision

The new public sales website is another sales channel, not a replacement for eBay or other marketplaces. Central inventory remains authoritative. Existing cross-channel sold/delist protection remains the operational model.

### New backend foundation

- `inventory_assets.catalog_product_id` links a physical inventory asset to its exact master catalogue product without guessing ambiguous matches.
- `sales_storefronts` stores storefront-level configuration, including empty-category behaviour.
- `sales_catalog_visibility` provides manufacturer/category/product visibility overrides with `auto`, `show` and `hide` modes.
- `catalog_sales_content` stores reusable product-level hero imagery, manufacturer imagery and product description separately from valuation data.
- `inventory_sales_content` stores item-specific condition description and listing presentation content separately from the master product.
- `staff_sales_market_evidence(uuid)` provides sales-permitted staff with read-only market evidence for pricing once an inventory asset is linked to a catalogue product.
- `staff_link_inventory_asset_catalog_product(uuid,uuid)` provides an explicit controlled link rather than unsafe automatic matching.

### Diagnostic Roadmap

See: `docs/DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAPS/PHASE2-RETAIL-STOREFRONT.md`

The public storefront repository has not yet been created because the retail brand/domain is still undecided. The shared Supabase infrastructure is intentionally brand-neutral at this stage.


## 6 September 2026 — DJI evidence reassignment and catalogue cleanup

- Fixed the live reassign_ai_candidate(...) RPC so it runs as SECURITY DEFINER while retaining its explicit staff check; this prevents the reassignment audit insert from being blocked by RLS.
- Compact mismatch routing UI: each VALID EVIDENCE — WRONG TARGET DETECTED workflow is now collapsed by default and opens only when routing is needed.
- During the DJI/MPB audit, clear controller/package identities were normalised to exact, accepted and applied to live comparison evidence.
- Clear wrong-target cases were reassigned conservatively: RC-N1, RC1, RC Pro Enterprise, Drone Only and generic Standard Package destinations where the source identity supported them.
- Generic evidence was not forced onto controller, Fly More, Plus, Cine or other specific variants without source support; those cases remain for review.
- Duplicate candidates may point to the same live evidence row after application; this is expected and avoids duplicate market evidence.


## 6 September 2026 — Gemma learning loop from catalogue corrections

The local worker already loads active records from `quote_catalog_ai_learning` and passes them into the Ollama/Gemma validation prompt as **ACTIVE HUMAN LEARNING / SOURCE-SPECIFIC RULES**. The DJI Deep Source audit has now been converted into explicit operational learning, not just historical notes.

Current DJI rules teach Gemma that:

- an explicitly named controller is package identity and beats a generic package label;
- a generic exact-model page must not be promoted into a specific Fly More, Cine, Creator, Plus or premium-controller package without evidence;
- **No RC** means **Drone Only**;
- missing package wording alone is not a positive mismatch;
- MPB UK search/category pages are discovery-only and exact `/en-uk/product/` pages are required for final evidence;
- high-confidence catalogue duplicate checks must compare package identity as well as model identity.

The worker was also updated to **1.5.5**. New Deep Source product candidates now run the existing catalogue duplicate check before creation and store either `likely_duplicate` or `no_high_confidence_duplicate`, with matching catalogue records attached for review. Same-model products with different controller/bundle identities are no longer treated as high-confidence duplicates merely because the base model matches.


### Phase 2 catalogue-to-inventory identity propagation

From 6 September 2026, the paid seller-purchase inventory creation path attempts a catalogue link only when manufacturer, model and package identify exactly one `quote_catalog_products` row. Ambiguous or missing matches remain unlinked for staff review; no fuzzy or family-level automatic matching is used. The relevant functions are `resolve_quote_item_catalog_product`, `staff_backfill_inventory_catalog_links` and the updated `staff_mark_sale_paid_and_create_inventory`.


## Inventory SKU and warehouse identity — 6 September 2026

Every physical item entering `inventory_assets` now receives an immutable unique GearCashOut SKU automatically. The SKU is the operational identity for the individual physical unit and is separate from the master `catalog_product_id` (which identifies the product type). Current format is `GCO-YYYY-######`.

This supports labels, barcode/QR implementation, warehouse location tracking, stock picking, marketplace/website listing reconciliation and audit history. Warehouse foundations are `inventory_locations` and `inventory_location_movements`; staff movement is recorded through `staff_move_inventory_asset`.


## Central Outlet → Listing → SKU architecture — 6 September 2026

Sales are now being standardised around a central model: **one physical inventory asset/SKU → many outlet listings**. The existing `resale_listings` table remains authoritative for listing lifecycle and sold/delist protection; a new `sales_outlets` registry identifies the outlet behind each listing. This supports owned storefronts, marketplaces and future auction outlets without duplicating inventory.

When one listing is marked Sold, the central sold workflow marks competing active listings for the same asset as **Delist Required** and marks the physical inventory asset Sold. This existing protection remains the single operational truth; outlet additions must not create independent sold-state logic.


## Package equivalence and retailer-aware alias learning — 6 September 2026

Gemma must not rely on exact package-name strings. GearCashOut catalogue products are the canonical identities, compared by manufacturer, model, controller, bundle/package, included accessories and variant. Alternative retailer descriptions may be learned as aliases, but aliases retain source/retailer provenance and confidence. Retailer-specific terminology is not automatically global.

Equivalence states are **confirmed**, **probable** and **ambiguous**. Only confirmed mappings may be used confidently; probable mappings are review suggestions; ambiguous mappings must not be forced. Positive conflicts such as controller identity, No RC, Fly More/Cine/Creator/Plus wording, battery count or package-defining accessories prevent automatic equivalence. New aliases require repeated exact evidence, independent confirmation or explicit human confirmation before promotion to confirmed learning.


## Dynamic Sales Workbench outlets — 6 September 2026

The Sales Workbench no longer uses a hard-coded marketplace array. Active outlet blocks are read from the central `sales_outlets` registry, filtered by the database to active outlets only. Each saved listing carries `outlet_id` while retaining the existing sales-channel display field for compatibility. This means new owned websites, specialist stores and future auction outlets can be added centrally without editing the Sales Workbench source.

Security: the browser uses the authenticated Supabase client and RLS-protected tables. The UI is not trusted as the authority for sold-state protection; the existing staff RPC/database workflow remains authoritative.


---

## 17Z. 6 September 2026 — DJI controller-aware package correction pass

A live review of new Gemma/MPB findings confirmed that generic model titles must be checked against the **exact product page and observed included controller**, not matched by the words “Standard Package” alone.

### Rules confirmed in live use

- An explicit controller in an exact listing is a package-defining identity component.
- If all observed units on an exact model page show the same controller, the evidence may be routed to that exact controller package.
- If the observed units contain mixed controllers, one aggregate price range must **not** be forced into a single controller package.
- An explicit **No RC** identity routes to **Drone Only**.
- A separately titled battery/accessory must be treated as its own catalogue product, not as a drone package.
- A controller-only identity must not be upgraded into **Fly More** unless the source positively proves the Fly More bundle.

### Catalogue additions made

- DJI Air 3S — Standard Package (DJI RC 2)
- DJI Mini 5 Pro — Standard Package (DJI RC-N3)
- DJI Neo — Drone Only
- DJI Mini 5 Pro Intelligent Flight Battery — Standard Item

The additions preserve controller/package identity while preventing MPB’s retailer wording from being mistaken for a different Fly More or premium bundle.

### Remaining ambiguity rule

Mixed-controller aggregate pages, such as the observed DJI Mini 4 Pro MPB page, remain pending until evidence can be separated by exact unit/package identity.


## Management-only Outlet Registry — 6 September 2026

Outlet administration is available only from the central **GearCashOut Staff Dashboard**, alongside the existing management-facing functions. Management users can open **OUTLET MANAGEMENT** to add an outlet and activate or deactivate it. The registry supports owned websites, marketplaces, auction outlets and other outlets.

Security and preservation rules:

- the page performs its own authenticated active-management check before rendering controls;
- database RLS separately enforces management-only writes;
- ordinary sales staff can read active outlets for legitimate listing work but cannot create or alter outlets;
- outlets are deactivated rather than deleted so historical listing relationships remain intact;
- no service-role credential is present in the browser.


## Management-only Outlet Registry — 6 September 2026

Outlet administration is accessed only from the central **GearCashOut Staff Dashboard**, alongside the existing management-facing functions. Management users can open **OUTLET MANAGEMENT** to add an outlet and activate or deactivate it. The registry supports owned websites, marketplaces, auction outlets and other outlets.

Security and preservation rules:

- authenticated active-management check before controls are usable;
- database RLS separately enforces management-only writes;
- ordinary sales staff cannot create or alter outlets;
- outlets are deactivated rather than deleted so historical listing relationships remain intact;
- no service-role credential is present in browser code.


## Slow-Moving Stock & Outlet Strategy — 6 September 2026

Management-only **SLOW-MOVING STOCK** is accessed from the central Staff Dashboard. It reports each unsold physical SKU's age, purchase cost, active listing count, active outlet coverage and an advisory strategy band.

Current advisory thresholds are 30 days (review), 60 days (expand outlets/price review), 90 days (urgent strategy review) and 120 days (auction/exit review). A sales-ready asset with no active listing is separately flagged.

This feature is deliberately read-only/advisory. It never automatically changes a price, moves stock to auction, closes listings or alters inventory status. Management decides any action through the existing controlled workflows.


## Outlet Coverage & Controlled Sales Handoff — 6 September 2026

The management-only Slow-Moving Stock page now compares every unsold SKU against the **active central Outlet Registry**. It shows:

- outlets currently carrying an active listing;
- the number of active registry outlets not currently carrying the SKU;
- the names of those missing outlets;
- a direct handoff into the existing Sales Workbench for that exact SKU.

The strategy page remains advisory. The handoff does not automatically publish, price, close or create listings; it opens the existing controlled Sales Workbench, where staff use the established listing workflow.


## Sales Dashboard Management Attention — 6 September 2026

The existing **Sales Dashboard** remains the operational workflow centre. A compact **MANAGEMENT ATTENTION → Stock Strategy** panel is now integrated into that dashboard for authorised management users.

It summarises:

- sales-ready stock with no active listing;
- stock at 120+ days requiring auction/exit review;
- stock at 90+ days requiring urgent strategy review;
- stock at 60+ days requiring outlet, price or presentation review;
- stock at 30+ days requiring routine review.

The panel links to the detailed **Slow-Moving Stock & Outlet Strategy** page. It does not create listings, publish products, change prices, move stock or close listings.

Ordinary sales staff do not receive this management panel. The browser checks active management permission before displaying it, while the underlying strategy RPC remains database-authorised for management only.

## Pending evidence alternative-product routing — 6 September 2026

Valid evidence must not disappear merely because its original catalogue target is wrong. Any pending candidate with a package/model/variant mismatch must expose the compact **VALID EVIDENCE — ROUTE TO AN ALTERNATIVE PRODUCT** control. The routing decision is preserved through `reassign_ai_candidate(...)`; the source finding is not recreated and duplicate live evidence is not created.

The UI must not depend solely on transient rendered dropdown values to decide whether the control exists. It checks both the visible review state and the persisted candidate mismatch state, with delayed rescans for asynchronous catalogue rendering. The compact panel remains collapsed by default so large audits do not produce pages of expanded controls.


---

## Unified What Needs Doing — Task Intelligence Upgrade — 6 September 2026

The shared **What Needs Doing** board now provides a more explicit operational priority layer across the main Staff Dashboard, Purchasing Dashboard and Sales Dashboard.

It continues to read existing workflow state; it does not create a second task database.

New behaviour:

- **CRITICAL** — immediate action requiring priority treatment, currently including duplicate marketplace listings marked for closure.
- **PRIORITY** — important operational actions, including confirmed customer payments awaiting recording and repair-required inventory.
- **OVERDUE** — workflow actions waiting beyond the normal review window.
- **CURRENT** — newly raised or recent actions.
- **FOCUS NEXT** — the highest-ranked live task provides a direct handoff into the existing workflow page.
- **WORK AREA FILTERS** — staff can temporarily filter the live board by Purchasing, Inventory, Sales, Returns and other categories present in the current workload.
- duplicate task keys are collapsed so the board does not show the same actionable item repeatedly.

The task board remains advisory and navigational. Opening a task takes staff to the existing workflow; it does not automatically change item status, send payments, publish listings, dispatch stock or close marketplace listings.

**Developer investigation map:** [Phase 2 Retail Storefront Diagnostic Roadmap](DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAPS/PHASE2-RETAIL-STOREFRONT.md).


## Pending evidence routing UI density — 6 September 2026

When many pending findings are valid evidence with a wrong catalogue target, the catalogue must not render a full routing box for every item. The routing workflow is now **lazy-open**:

1. A mismatch candidate shows one compact **ROUTE TO ALTERNATIVE PRODUCT** control inside its existing evidence card.
2. The searchable destination selector and move action are created only when that control is pressed.
3. The existing `reassign_ai_candidate(...)` RPC, reassignment audit table and preservation rules are unchanged.
4. Removing the mismatch state removes the compact control/panel.

This is a UI-density correction only. No candidate, evidence, catalogue product or learning record is changed by rendering the compact control.


### Follow-up fault — routing MutationObserver loop

A follow-up test exposed a browser freeze: pending records whose editable fields initially displayed as NOT CHECKED could be server-confirmed mismatches. The observer then alternated between removing and recreating the routing control. The routing script now caches the server route state per card and uses an in-flight check guard, preventing DOM mutation loops. Cache version is `20260906-alternative-route-5`.


### Follow-up regression — alternative-product routing disappeared after freeze repair

The freeze repair prevented the MutationObserver loop, but a separate startup race remained. The reassignment script can run before window.actionBuyerAuth.supabase is ready. In that state getCandidateRouteState() returned null, and the previous repair cached the card as not-required. That incorrectly suppressed ROUTE TO ALTERNATIVE PRODUCT for genuine pending database mismatches.

Repair: an unavailable/failed server lookup now leaves the card in unknown, with bounded retries. Only a successful database response may set required or not-required. The existing loop protection remains: required controls are not repeatedly removed/recreated. Cache version: 20260906-alternative-route-6.


### Alternative-product search performance fix — 6 September 2026

The routing panel must not preload the full active catalogue into a native select. The catalogue currently contains thousands of active products; injecting them all into the select made the page sluggish and made the search appear inactive. The panel now requires at least 2 search characters, returns a maximum of 100 matches, and reports the match count. The selected reassignment workflow and server-side RPC are unchanged. Cache version: 20260906-alternative-route-7.


### Catalogue stability fix — 6 September 2026

The alternative-product reassignment script must not rescan the entire document for every DOM mutation. The previous broad MutationObserver watched the full document and called a full catalogue scan on each mutation, including DOM changes made by the reassignment script itself. During rendering/scrolling this could create heavy repeated work and renderer instability. The observer now batches only added DOM roots and processes pending-candidate cards inside those roots. Existing initial scans and field-change handling remain in place. Cache version: 20260906-alternative-route-8.


---

## Controlled Phase 2 Test Stock — 6 September 2026

A controlled sample batch of **8 inventory assets and 4 resale listings** was created to allow the Inventory → Sales → Outlet infrastructure to be tested before genuine purchasing stock is available.

The records are linked to real quote_catalog_products and receive normal production-format SKUs. They are explicitly marked in their inventory notes as **TEST DATA**.

The existing management-only **Delete All Test Data** route uses reset_test_quote_data() and already deletes, in dependency order:

1. inventory return data;
2. customer return requests;
3. resale transactions;
4. resale listings;
5. inventory assets;
6. purchasing test records and related workflow data.

Therefore no separate sales-test deletion button was required.

The current batch covers Ready for Resale, Inspection Required, Repair Required, Sent to Sales, Draft website listing, Published Website/eBay listings, Delist Required duplicate-listing scenario, and stock ages ranging from recent to 120+ days.

These records are for system testing only and must not be treated as genuine stock or financial history.


### Alternative-product routing stability repair — 6 September 2026

The missing-routing-control and catalogue-shudder regression was traced to two separate client-side render races:

1. the reassignment script repeatedly discovered cards through startup scans/DOM observation;
2. the pending-review script repeatedly replaced the entire pending evidence section during its eight-pass startup retry loop.

The stable design is now:

- admin-catalog-pending-ai-review.js renders ROUTE TO ALTERNATIVE PRODUCT directly from the authoritative persisted candidate mismatch fields;
- admin-catalog-ai-evidence-reassignment.js only handles clicks and direct field changes;
- there is no document-wide MutationObserver, delayed full-page routing scan or per-mutation rescan;
- opening the route control still verifies the candidate server state before moving evidence;
- the pending section is rendered once per authoritative pending-data refresh, not repeatedly during startup.

Do not restore either the old repeated pending-section retry loop or a global routing observer to solve future display problems.


## Catalogue cleanup audit — 6 September 2026

A post-repair cleanup removed obsolete catalogue bootstrap and legacy scripts that were no longer referenced by the live page. The old bootstrap could dynamically inject the market-structure and evidence-tools scripts even though the page already loaded them directly, creating a risk of duplicate listeners and duplicate observers.

The live catalogue now has one direct load path for those scripts. The reassignment layer also had leftover retry/refresh code from the earlier observer-based approach; that unreachable discovery path was removed. Route controls remain renderer-owned and interaction remains event-driven.

Removed legacy/unreferenced files:
- admin-catalog-boot-fix.js
- admin-catalog-accordion-fix.js
- admin-catalog-accordion.js
- admin-catalog-discontinued-label.js
- admin-catalog-list-active.js
- admin-catalog-online-comparison-guard.js
- admin-catalog-online-comparison-history.js
- admin-catalog-online-comparison.js

Do not restore dynamic duplicate script injection or the retired route-state rescan path unless a new, tested ownership model is documented first.


---

## Duplicate Listing Closure Control — repaired 6 September 2026

The Sales Dashboard urgent warning now opens a dedicated staff page:

`delist-actions.html`

Each outstanding **Delist Required** action shows:

- exact product;
- SKU;
- asset reference;
- the sales channel and listing reference that must be closed;
- the channel recorded as sold, where available;
- every other recorded listing/channel for the same physical SKU;
- an explicit **OPEN SALES WORKBENCH** handoff;
- an optional live-listing link when one has been recorded;
- an explicit **CONFIRM LISTING CLOSED** action.

The system does **not** attempt to close a third-party marketplace listing automatically. Staff close it on the marketplace first, then confirm closure in GearCashOut.

The closure RPC now also requires an **active** staff account, not merely a historical staff_users row.


## Catalogue consolidation rule — exact evidence only (6 September 2026)

When duplicate or overlapping catalogue package rows are removed:

1. inspect every dependent evidence/candidate/queue record before deleting the product;
2. move evidence only where the source explicitly supports the destination package/controller identity;
3. if the exact same evidence already exists on the correct destination, remove the redundant duplicate rather than creating another copy;
4. never force ambiguous model-level evidence into a remaining package merely because the duplicate row is being removed;
5. accessory-only evidence must not be merged into a drone bundle unless the source proves the bundle itself;
6. remove stale AI candidates that embody a known incorrect forced-routing decision rather than preserving them as future training examples;
7. retain the decision and reason in structured project memory/checkpoints.

### DJI Mavic 3 Classic application

The overlapping **Standard Package** and accessory-only **Fly More Kit** catalogue rows were removed after clear evidence was consolidated into:

- **Drone Only** where the official Drone Only identity was already represented;
- **Standard Package (DJI RC)** where the source explicitly identified DJI RC;
- **Fly More Combo** where the source explicitly identified the complete combo.

Generic MPB/model-level evidence and exact accessory-only Fly More Kit evidence were not reassigned to a guessed drone package. This preserves the core rule that uncertainty must remain unresolved rather than being converted into false package certainty.


---

## Valuation Catalogue Duplicate-Option Guard — 6 September 2026

A reported customer-side duplicate Mavic 3 Classic package display was investigated against the live Supabase catalogue before deleting any product.

### Database result

The live active/customer-visible DJI Mavic 3 Classic catalogue contains four distinct package identities:

- Drone Only;
- Fly More Combo;
- Standard Package (DJI RC-N1);
- Standard Package (DJI RC).

No duplicate normalised manufacturer + model + package-key rows were present. The controller-specific Standard Packages must remain separate because they represent different package identities.

### Front-end protection

The valuation wizard remains database-driven through:

`valuation.html` → `quote-reverse-basket-v5.js` → `quote_catalog_products`.

A defence-in-depth `quote-catalog-dropdown-guard.js` now removes only true duplicate dropdown identities:

- categories/product types/manufacturers/models by normalised display identity;
- packages by normalised package key.

This does not collapse legitimate controller variants. The valuation script cache version was also advanced so browsers fetch the current catalogue code rather than continuing to use an older cached script.

### Diagnostic lesson

Before deleting an apparent duplicate from the catalogue, verify the live normalised database identity and distinguish:

**same model + same package key = duplicate candidate**

from:

**same model + different controller/package key = legitimate package variant**.

## Repair Required → Testing → Ready for Resale repair — 6 September 2026

The Product Workbench now correctly handles a successful **post-repair test**.

Previously, if an asset was already in **Repair Required**, staff could save passing inspection/testing results, but the transition code only promoted assets when their current status was already **Testing**. The item therefore remained stuck in **Repair Required**, and the Send to Sales control stayed blocked.

The repaired flow is:

`Repair Required` → repair completed → `Testing` → post-repair tests pass → `Ready for Resale` → **Send to Sales**.

The completion panel now also explains the exact blocking reason instead of leaving staff with an apparently unresponsive disabled button.


---

## Explicit Repair Required workflow — 6 September 2026

Repair Required is now a dedicated Product Workbench workflow rather than a hidden status. When an asset is in **Repair Required**, staff see a prominent warning with the recorded fault and cannot continue normal inspection/testing by simply saving passing values.

The repair record captures the fault, repair work, repairer type/name, repair cost, completion date and optional evidence. The controlled database function `staff_complete_inventory_repair(...)` requires an **active staff user**, requires the asset to be in **Repair Required**, records the repair, optionally creates a linked `inventory_expenses` Repair cost, and moves the asset to **Testing**.

**Expense category contract:** `inventory_expenses.category` explicitly includes `Repair`. This must remain aligned with the repair RPC and the inventory cost UI; otherwise a valid repair cost will cause the whole repair transaction to fail.

Workflow: `Repair Required` → **record completed repair** → `Testing` → **post-repair test** → `Ready for Resale` → `Sent to Sales`.

There is deliberately no generic **Clear Repair Required** button.


### Sales Pipeline repair visibility — 6 September 2026

The Sales Dashboard must show **Repair Required** as a separate blocking pipeline category. Repair-held stock must not disappear inside the general Inventory total: the Inventory card counts non-repair inventory workflow states, while the red Repair Required card counts assets blocked pending a completed repair. See the Phase 2 Retail Storefront Diagnostic Roadmap.


---

## Multi-AI Coordination and Shared Project Memory — 6 September 2026

GearCashOut is currently being developed by more than one ChatGPT technical agent working on different parts of the same repository and Supabase project. At present, one stream is concentrating on the **AI research / Gemma / Quote Catalogue** system while another is building the **sales, inventory and resale** side.

These are not separate projects. They share the same live sources of truth:

1. current GitHub repository state;
2. current Supabase schema and data;
3. the Human / Developer System Handbook;
4. the AI Operating Manual;
5. Supabase structured project memory, decisions, rules, events and checkpoints.

### Mandatory coordination rule

Before making a material change, an AI must check whether another development stream has recently changed the same area or an upstream/downstream dependency.

The safe sequence is:

**Retrieve shared memory → inspect current checkpoint/events → inspect current GitHub → inspect current Supabase → identify ownership/overlap → change minimally → test → document.**

Do not assume the latest current checkpoint represents the only active stream. A sales checkpoint may coexist with active AI research, and active research events may continue while sales development is underway.

### Checkpoints and concurrent work

A checkpoint is a snapshot of a workstream, not exclusive ownership of the entire project. One agent must not overwrite or invalidate another agent's active checkpoint merely to record its own progress.

For concurrent work:

- use **area-specific events** for material changes;
- add or update checkpoints only for the relevant workstream;
- preserve other current context unless a genuine system-wide state supersedes it;
- record affected files, database objects and dependencies;
- distinguish **Implemented**, **Tested** and **Verified Live**.

### Cross-system protection

Changes in one stream must be checked for effects on the other. Examples include:

- inventory and sales code sharing catalogue product identities;
- AI research changing catalogue data later used by valuation, purchasing or sales;
- shared navigation, authentication, staff permissions, RLS and common JavaScript;
- project-memory events arriving while another agent is working.

The manuals and Supabase memory are therefore the coordination layer between concurrent technical agents, not merely documentation written after the fact.


---

## Product Workbench — Repair Completion and Testing Rule (6 September 2026)

### Current workflow

A completed repair is now the controlled post-repair testing step.

`Inspection/Testing failure → Repair Required → Record completed repair + mark tested → Ready for Resale → Send to Sales`

The Product Workbench must not return a repaired item to a separate Testing stage.

### Diagnostic route

**User action:** Complete the repair in the Product Workbench.

**Front end:** `inventory-workbench.js`, repair form and `staff_complete_inventory_repair(...)` RPC call.

**Supabase:**

- `inventory_assets`
- `inventory_repairs`
- `inventory_expenses`
- `inventory_testing`
- `staff_complete_inventory_repair(...)`

### Expected data flow

Repair form
→ authenticated active staff session
→ optional repair evidence upload
→ secure repair RPC
→ asset row lock and Repair Required validation
→ optional Repair expense
→ repair history row
→ explicit Passed testing row
→ asset status `Ready for Resale`
→ existing Sales completion gate.

### Security and completion rule

The workflow does not restore a generic bypass. The RPC still requires an active staff account and an asset currently in `Repair Required`.

Repair completion does **not** automatically send stock to Sales. Existing package, condition and other Sales gates remain authoritative.

**Related checkpoint:** `CHECKPOINTS/2026-09-06-repair-completion-marks-tested.md`.


## Inspection outcome: Requires Repair — 6 September 2026

For staff inventory inspection, **Requires Repair** is a completed inspection outcome, not an unfinished inspection.

The operational route is:

`Inspection Required → Requires Repair → Repair Required → Complete Repair & Mark Tested → Ready for Resale`

The Product Workbench gives an explicit on-screen notification when the item is routed:

**Inspection complete: REQUIRES REPAIR. The item has been moved to Repair Required.**

The repair screen then shows the recorded fault/defect so staff can see what requires repair before completing the controlled repair-and-test step.

Developer investigation map:

`docs/DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAPS/INVENTORY-REPAIR-AND-SALES-WORKFLOW.md`
### Sales handoff after repair

A repaired item whose original inspection outcome was **Requires Repair** is not forced to repeat the original inspection merely to satisfy the Sales handoff. GearCashOut accepts that inspection outcome only after a completed repair record exists. All other Sales requirements remain in force.

---

## Sales Dashboard Quick Stock Search — 6 September 2026

The Sales Dashboard now includes a compact **Search Stock** control for staff.

Search modes:

- **SKU** — physical unit SKU, for example `GCO-2026-100015`;
- **Transaction number** — the source purchasing/sale transaction;
- **Product** — manufacturer + model text;
- **All** — searches all three identifiers together.

Results show the product, SKU, transaction number and current workflow status, with a direct **VIEW ITEM** handoff to `inventory-detail.html?id=<asset_id>`.

This is a read-only convenience search over the existing `inventory_assets` truth. It does not create a separate stock index or change workflow state.


## Post-sale fulfilment and customer returns — 6 September 2026

The resale workflow now continues after an item is marked **Sold**. The physical inventory record remains the authoritative sold record and stays visible in **Sold Items**; fulfilment is tracked separately.

**Sold → Create/record shipping label → Ready for Collection (optional) → Collected → Delivered**

`sales_fulfillments` records buyer/shipping details, carrier, tracking, label URL and timestamps.

### Separate customer-return process

`purchase_return_cases` remains for customer-owned items GearCashOut did **not** purchase during Purchasing. Post-sale buyer returns use the separate `sales_customer_returns` workflow:

**Requested → Approved → Label Created → Collected → Item Received → Resolved/Refused**

When a buyer return is physically received, the inventory asset moves to **Returned** for review while sold history remains recorded.

**Roadmap:** `docs/DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAPS/INVENTORY-REPAIR-AND-SALES-WORKFLOW.md`.

## Product Workbench Sales Handoff Mode — 6 September 2026

Once an item has been handed to Sales, the Product Workbench must stop presenting inspection/testing as a workflow that can be repeated.

For statuses `Sent to Sales`, `Listed`, `Reserved` and `Sold`, `inventory-sales-handoff.js` replaces the active workbench view with:

- **INSPECTION COMPLETE · SENT TO SALES** handoff status;
- retained inspection/testing summary;
- a controlled inspection-report correction handoff;
- reusable catalogue content editing through `catalog_sales_content`;
- individual-item condition/listing/hero editing through `inventory_sales_content`;
- separate customer-supplied photograph evidence;
- editable staff photographs, including individual-item hero selection;
- direct handoff to the Sales Workbench.

This deliberately reuses the Phase 2 sales-content tables rather than creating another description or image system.

Developer roadmap: `docs/DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAPS/INVENTORY-REPAIR-AND-SALES-WORKFLOW.md`.


---

## Post-Sale Shipping, Return Window and UK Tax-Year Archive — 6 September 2026

The sales lifecycle is now:

`Listed / Reserved → Sold - Awaiting Shipping → Sold - Shipped → Returned (if applicable) → Archived`

- **Sold - Awaiting Shipping:** the item has sold and requires carrier/tracking and collection.
- **Sold - Shipped:** the parcel has been collected and remains in the post-sale return-monitoring period.
- **Delivered:** recorded in `sales_fulfillments`; delivery starts the current **30-day operational return hold**.
- **Customer return:** starts only from a delivered shipped item and remains separate from Purchase Returns.
- **Archived:** after the return hold ends, with no open customer return, the item is archived without deleting accounting, inspection, evidence, research or sales history.
- **UK tax-year archive:** archive records are grouped using the UK tax year, 6 April to 5 April, based on the sale date.

Staff entry points:

- `sold-items.html` — Post-Sale shipping and return-window work.
- `sales-customer-returns.html` — buyer return cases.
- `sales-archive.html` — completed records grouped by UK tax year.

**Developer Diagnostic Roadmap:** [Inventory Repair and Sales Workflow](DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAPS/INVENTORY-REPAIR-AND-SALES-WORKFLOW.md)


---

## Post-sale status reconciliation — 6 September 2026

A live test record (**TEST-ASSET-007**) exposed a status mismatch: the linked `sales_fulfillments` row was already **Collected**, while `inventory_assets.status` remained **Sold**. The record was reconciled to **Sold - Shipped** without altering the sold listing or fulfilment history.

The current live `staff_update_sales_fulfillment(..., 'collected')` definition was then inspected and confirmed to contain the required asset update to **Sold - Shipped**. The observed mismatch could not be reproduced from the current function definition, so the incident is retained as a data-reconciliation fault rather than attributing an unverified root cause.

Operational check: after marking a parcel collected, verify both the fulfilment status and `inventory_assets.status` before proceeding to delivery.

## Customer Return Assessment and Financial Closure — 7 September 2026

A buyer return is not considered operationally complete merely because the item has physically arrived back.

### Return label

When the return label is created, staff can record:

- carrier;
- tracking number;
- label URL;
- **cost of the return label**.

### Before resolving a received return

The system now requires staff to record the operational outcome, including:

- what happened;
- damage or condition found;
- what happened to the returned item;
- customer resolution.

The returned-item outcome can be recorded as:

- Returned to Stock / Resale;
- Sent to Auction;
- Broken Down for Spares;
- Sent for Repair;
- Second-hand Spares Sale;
- Written Off / Recycled;
- Other.

### Customer refund or replacement

Where relevant, the return closure can retain:

- full or partial refund;
- replacement item;
- refund and replacement;
- no customer payment;
- refund method;
- payment provider/processor, such as Stripe;
- refund amount;
- refund transaction/reference;
- linked replacement inventory asset or replacement reference;
- replacement notes.

This information is retained as part of the customer-return record so the future accounts system has a traceable source record.

**Diagnostic Roadmap:** [Inventory Repair and Sales Workflow](DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAPS/INVENTORY-REPAIR-AND-SALES-WORKFLOW.md)


## Live Task Board Customer Return Routing — 7 September 2026

The staff **What Needs Doing** board now reads the authoritative post-sale table `sales_customer_returns` for buyer-return actions.

An **Item Received** return opens `sales-customer-returns.html`, where staff complete the assessment, damage/condition, item disposition and customer financial/replacement details before resolution. It must not route to the older `returns.html` page, which uses the separate legacy return workflow and can incorrectly show no requests.

**Diagnostic Roadmap:** [Inventory Repair and Sales Workflow](DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAPS/INVENTORY-REPAIR-AND-SALES-WORKFLOW.md)


## Known Fault and Repair — Duplicate Returned-Item Live Task (7 September 2026)

After the customer-return routing repair, one further first-failure check found that the same received return could generate **two** Live Task Board actions:

1. the authoritative **CUSTOMER RETURNS → Complete returned item assessment** task from `sales_customer_returns`; and
2. a generic **SALES → Review returned item** task from `inventory_assets.status='Returned'`.

The first path is correct. The second path can open the generic Product Workbench and bypass the intended return-assessment destination.

**Repair:** `live-task-board.js` now builds the set of assets with open customer-return cases and suppresses the generic `Returned` asset task for those assets. The authoritative `sales_customer_returns` task remains the only CTA for the received buyer return.

**Diagnostic Roadmap:** [Inventory Repair and Sales Workflow](DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAPS/INVENTORY-REPAIR-AND-SALES-WORKFLOW.md)


### Customer return transaction context

The **Customer Returns** assessment screen now displays the original transaction alongside the return timeline: when the item was sold, the price paid by the customer, sales channel, when the return was opened, collected and physically received.

The sale facts are read from the linked `inventory_assets` record and the return dates from `sales_customer_returns`, so staff can assess and close the return with the transaction context visible without duplicating accounting data manually. See the **Inventory Repair and Sales Workflow Diagnostic Roadmap** for the exact data flow.

## Follow-up repair — resolved customer-return links and stale actions

Browser testing after completing **CSR-E768FABB1E5B** exposed a second-stage routing problem.

Live state was verified as:

- `sales_customer_returns.status = 'Resolved'`;
- `inventory_assets.status = 'Returned'`;
- the return assessment and customer financial details were already completed.

Two stale routes remained:

1. the lower **OPEN RETURNS** CTA on the Sales Dashboard still linked to legacy `returns.html`;
2. the generic `Returned` asset workflow could still create **Review returned item** and route to the Product Workbench after the customer return was already resolved.

### Repair

- Sales Dashboard lower CTA now opens `sales-customer-returns.html` as **OPEN CUSTOMER RETURNS**.
- Sales Dashboard return attention counts now use `sales_customer_returns` for active customer-return cases and do not treat a resolved customer-return asset as a fresh generic return review.
- The generic `Returned` task is suppressed for any asset that has a post-sale `sales_customer_returns` record, preventing the Product Workbench route from reappearing after closure.

### Rule

A completed post-sale customer return must not continue to generate legacy return or generic Product Workbench actions. The authoritative record remains `sales_customer_returns`; once terminal, it is history rather than live work.

## MPB Deep Source discovery repair — 7 September 2026

Worker **1.5.6** keeps direct HTTP as the first path. When MPB returns HTTP 403, the local Chromium fallback through `playwright-core` is now also used for MPB internal-search and discovery/crawl pages, not just exact product pages. This is a discovery repair only: landing, category, search and subcategory pages remain discovery-only and can never become final evidence. Exact `/en-uk/product/...` pages are still fetched and validated separately before evidence is created.

### 7 September 2026 — MPB Deep Source 403/404 discovery gap

Live Sony auditing proved that deterministic slugs alone were not sufficient. The worker marked products such as Sony PXW-Z190, PXW-Z150 and PMW-200 as completed without candidates even though live MPB pages existed under URLs with retailer-specific suffixes such as `-4k-camcorder` or `-camcorder`.

The first failure was discovery: Node HTTP received MPB 403 responses on internal search and crawl pages, while a deterministic guessed slug could return 404. The previous browser fallback only helped after an exact URL was already known.

The repair extends the existing MPB browser fallback to discovery pages after HTTP 403. Those pages are still only maps; exact evidence remains restricted to validated exact MPB product pages. This prevents a guessed 404 URL from becoming the worker's only route when MPB uses a retailer-specific product suffix.


## Customer Returns Record Display — 7 September 2026

Each post-sale customer return on **Customer Returns** is now an individual collapsible record. The collapsed header keeps the product, return status, return reference and SKU visible; expanding it reveals the transaction timeline, reason, customer notes and the relevant workflow or resolved accounting record. Active cases remain open by default so required staff actions are immediately accessible.


## Stock Strategy Report Repair — 7 September 2026

The **Slow-Moving Stock & Outlet Strategy** page briefly failed with `column reference "count" is ambiguous`, followed by **Unable to load strategy report**. The fault was inside `management_stock_strategy_report()`: aggregate COUNT() columns in the listing summary had been left unnamed and were later referenced through generated names (`count` / `count_1`).

The repair gives the aggregates explicit names: `active_listing_count` and `active_outlet_count`. The report remains management-only and advisory. No inventory, listing, price or outlet data is changed by the repair.

**Diagnostic Roadmap:** `docs/DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAPS/PHASE2-RETAIL-STOREFRONT.md`.


---

## Research PC deployment integrity rule — 7 September 2026

A live failure exposed a partial-deployment hazard: the Research PC received a newer `agent.mjs` whose lifecycle commands had moved to `supervisor.mjs`, while its local startup path still used `npm start → agent.mjs`. The worker could research and heartbeat, but queued dashboard lifecycle commands were never consumed.

### Required deployment contract

The Research PC control chain is:

**Windows launcher → Start-GearCashOut-AI.ps1 → npm start / supervisor.mjs → agent.mjs**

The following files are a single control deployment set and must be updated together when lifecycle architecture changes:

- `tools/gear-ai-local-agent/package.json`
- `tools/gear-ai-local-agent/supervisor.mjs`
- `tools/gear-ai-local-agent/agent.mjs`
- the Windows launcher when its implementation changes

Current package behaviour:

- `npm start` starts the persistent supervisor;
- `npm run worker` is a controlled direct worker command for development only.

The supervisor expires queued lifecycle commands older than 10 minutes at startup so stale commands from an unavailable or wrongly deployed control channel cannot replay against a recovered worker.

**Diagnostic roadmap:** `docs/DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAPS/AI-RESEARCH-PC-CONTROL.md`.


## Stock Strategy Outlet Coverage Display Repair — 7 September 2026

A live visual check found that the Slow-Moving Stock table was displaying the missing-outlet figure beneath the **ACTIVE OUTLETS** heading. The report data itself was correct: for the tested Accsoon CineView HE, there was one active published listing on the GearCashOut Retail Website and eight other active registry outlets not carrying the SKU.

The table now displays active listing count, active outlet coverage and missing outlet count as separate values. No listing, inventory or outlet record was changed.

**Diagnostic Roadmap:** `docs/DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAPS/PHASE2-RETAIL-STOREFRONT.md`.


---

## Deep Source Website Selector (7 September 2026)

The AI Research Centre Deep Source audit no longer relies on Chrome's native URL datalist. The interface now has:

- a normal dropdown containing all approved live research websites;
- alphabetical ordering by hostname after removing a leading `www.`;
- a separate full-URL input for a website not already listed;
- a **SAVE WEBSITE TO LIST** action.

Saving a new URL remembers it for the local Deep Source selector and also registers it with the shared AI source registry for review. A newly discovered source is not automatically approved/enabled for normal AI research merely because it has been saved for Deep Source use.

## Research run completion visibility and recovery guard — 7 September 2026

A live Sony Deep Source run was investigated after the PowerShell window appeared to stop progressing. Supabase proved the run had actually reached its terminal state: all five queue items were finished and the run was marked completed_with_errors; the remaining PowerShell output was only the opening-source monitor.

The Research PC worker now makes terminal completion explicit in its own log after the final product, including the run ID, finished count and error count. This prevents a completed audit from looking like an idle/frozen worker.

The queue recovery guard was also corrected from 1 minute to 5 minutes, matching the existing restart-recovery design and reducing the risk of a legitimate long-running product being incorrectly recovered as interrupted.

HTTP 403 responses from monitored opening-soon storefronts remain non-fatal. Repeated blocked-source notices are rate-limited so they do not bury real research activity in the PowerShell log.


---

## 17H. 7 September 2026 — Real MPB research stall distinguished from monitor noise

A later Sony MPB Deep Source run exposed a different failure from the earlier completed-run incident.

### Verified live state

Supabase showed a new run with:

- 0 products checked;
- 2 queue items simultaneously in `processing`;
- 3 still queued.

Because the local worker is intended to process one queue item sequentially, the simultaneous claims proved that duplicate worker/supervisor activity was possible.

### Failure path

The MPB browser fallback could hang during Chromium startup because browser launch did not have an explicit timeout. The queue item then remained `processing`.

### Repository repair

- MPB Chromium launch/context/page/content operations now have explicit limits and progress logging.
- Deep Source collection has a product-level watchdog.
- The Research PC supervisor now uses a single-instance local lock to prevent a second launcher from starting another worker with the same agent identity.

### Important operational rule

Do not diagnose every quiet PowerShell window as harmless opening-source monitoring. Check the live queue:

- one processing item progressing normally can be valid;
- all rows terminal means the run is complete;
- multiple simultaneous processing rows for this single sequential worker indicate duplicate worker activity;
- a processing row that exceeds the collection watchdog must fail/recover rather than remain indefinitely stuck.

Deployment must be verified on the local Research PC before this repair can be called live.

## 7 September 2026 — MPB Deep Source candidate admission repair

A live Sony Deep Source run exposed a second collection failure after the Chromium fallback repair.

### Verified first failure

The Research PC was collecting unrelated MPB exact product pages. The live worker log showed a Sony product job sequentially opening multiple Fujifilm MPB URLs before the 180-second product watchdog failed the Sony queue row.

### Root cause

The Deep Source link scoring gave an exact MPB product path enough points to pass the candidate threshold by itself. MPB pages containing many product links could therefore admit unrelated products into final validation.

### Repair

- exact product-path status now contributes only a small ranking bonus;
- non-deterministic candidates must also contain sufficient target identity to pass admission;
- deterministic MPB product slugs remain explicit source-specific discovery paths;
- the Deep Source watchdog now aborts the collector context so a timed-out job cannot continue through further candidate pages in the background.

Expected flow:

catalogue identity → target-aware MPB candidate admission → exact-page validation → evidence extraction → queue completion.


---

## 7 September 2026 — Deep Source crawl isolation and terminal-state consistency

A further live Sony MPB Deep Source test proved that the previous candidate-admission repair was incomplete.

### Verified behaviour

Supabase recorded the Sony Alpha 1 II queue row as failed at the 180-second watchdog and the run as terminal, while the Research PC PowerShell window continued logging MPB browser fallback requests for many unrelated exact product URLs.

The Deep Source dashboard therefore returned to **RUN DEEP SOURCE AUDIT** because the authoritative database run was already terminal. The apparent dashboard mismatch was caused by an orphaned local collector still crawling after the queue item had failed, not by the dashboard incorrectly hiding an active database run.

### Root cause

Two discovery-path gaps remained:

1. exact MPB product links below the target-candidate threshold could still be placed into the breadth-first discovery queue and fetched as if they were category pages;
2. the watchdog aborted the controller, but the crawl and discovery loops did not consistently check the abort signal, allowing background MPB requests to continue until the loops naturally ended.

### Repair

`tools/gear-ai-local-agent/agent.mjs` now:

- treats exact product pages as terminal discovery links;
- never queues a low-scoring unrelated exact product page for further crawling;
- checks the Deep Source abort signal throughout MPB discovery, internal search, crawl and final validation loops;
- stops further crawl work promptly after the 180-second watchdog fires;
- identifies the repaired worker as version `1.5.9-worker`.

Expected result: a Sony Deep Source job may traverse relevant discovery/category paths, but it must not sequentially open unrelated Fujifilm, Nikon or other manufacturer product pages merely because they appear on MPB landing/category HTML.

The dashboard's active indicator remains database-driven: queued/running runs or queue rows in queued/claimed/processing are active. Once the local collector stops with the queue row, the UI and Research PC state remain consistent.


---

## 7 September 2026 — AI Research Centre startup freeze recovery

A live dashboard failure showed the Deep Source website selector stuck on **Loading approved websites…** while the Research PC Remote Controls remained on **Checking…** and none of the control buttons were wired.

### First failure point

admin-ai-research.js called window.actionBuyerAuth.getSession() before wiring any dashboard controls. That helper performs an additional profile lookup. If that lookup stalled, the entire Research Centre startup remained blocked before:

- the Deep Source selector was rendered;
- Research PC controls were attached;
- initial live-status loads started.

### Repair

Startup now:

- waits briefly only for the Supabase client object;
- uses the direct Supabase auth.getSession() call rather than the profile-loading auth helper;
- bounds authentication and source/status calls with timeouts;
- never leaves the source selector permanently displaying a fake Loading state;
- uses a new script cache version so browsers receive the repaired JavaScript.

This is a front-end startup/control-channel repair. It does not change research queue data or worker lifecycle state.


### Research PC deployment integrity — 2026-09-07

The Research PC is a local deployment and does not update automatically when GitHub changes. AI Research fixes must therefore be treated as two stages: repository repair and Research PC deployment/verification. A heartbeat/version check is required before declaring a worker fix live.

Deep Source release 1.5.10 specifically contains orphan-crawl containment: a 180000ms product timeout now aborts the active MPB browser fallback, closes Playwright resources, and blocks late discovery persistence into a terminal run. Controlled testing must start with one product before restoring larger batches.


---

## Deep Source MPB target-isolation repair — 7 September 2026 (1.5.11)

### Observed failure

A live Sony Alpha 1 II Deep Source run reached the 180-second watchdog while the Research PC repeatedly opened unrelated MPB Sony category, guide and content URLs.

### First failure

The remaining fault was not the supervisor, Ollama, queue lifecycle or watchdog. MPB's generic same-domain breadth-first crawl was still allowed to expand non-product links using broad manufacturer/category relevance. Those pages were discovery-only by design, but they could still consume the product watchdog budget.

### Current repair

For MPB Deep Source audits:

1. deterministic MPB exact-product slugs remain available;
2. site-constrained external discovery remains available;
3. MPB internal search remains available;
4. unrelated exact MPB product links must visibly contain the requested catalogue model before admission;
5. MPB generic category/content/guide pages are no longer expanded into the breadth-first crawl;
6. final MPB candidates must either be the explicit deterministic slug or visibly identify the requested model;
7. the existing abort, browser closure, terminal-run and watchdog protections remain unchanged.

### Expected data flow

`Deep Source URL`
→ exact deterministic/search discovery
→ target-model identity gate
→ exact `/en-uk/product/...` candidate
→ HTTP fetch or Playwright fallback
→ final title/canonical identity validation
→ MPB reference-only range extraction
→ Pending Evidence Review.

Generic MPB category, brand and editorial/content pages may help a human understand the site but are not permitted to consume the product crawl as successive browser targets.

### Verification rule

A one-product MPB test must show:

- only target-relevant MPB discovery/fallback URLs;
- no long sequence of unrelated category or editorial pages;
- no unrelated manufacturer/model exact product pages;
- queue state remains consistent with actual local work;
- worker heartbeat reports the deployed release before a larger batch is started.


## 7 September 2026 — Deep Source manufacturer/URL isolation repair (worker 1.5.12)

A Deep Source run is a **collection mode**, not an evidence category. `deep_source` must never be compared directly with `new_uk`, `used_uk`, `official` or `overseas`.

The repair was made after Sony Alpha 1 II exact MPB pages were successfully discovered but discarded before candidate creation because the manual-review fallback compared `used_uk !== deep_source`.

Worker 1.5.12 now enforces:

- manufacturer + model identify the current target only;
- source/domain rules can be generic, but manufacturer-specific patterns cannot leak into another manufacturer;
- DJI MPB URL/extraction success does not become a Sony requirement, and Sony suffixes do not alter DJI matching;
- retailer-specific URL suffixes are validated by page identity rather than one manufacturer's slug pattern;
- a Deep Source exact page remains eligible for its real evidence category;
- MPB and fallback dedupe only mark a URL handled after successful candidate persistence.

Regression set: DJI × MPB, Sony × MPB, and a future manufacturer × selected source.


---

## MPB exact-page inventory readiness repair — 7 September 2026 (1.5.13)

A successful 1.5.12 Sony × MPB regression proved that manufacturer × URL isolation was fixed: the run created new Pending Review rows instead of repeating the earlier DJI/Sony cross-rule failure. The remaining first failure was later in collection.

MPB exact product pages are client-rendered. The browser fallback previously waited a fixed 2.5 seconds after DOMContentLoaded, which could capture the model title before the live SKU/price inventory rows had rendered. The result was an exact URL reaching manual preservation with no price range.

Worker 1.5.13 now:

- waits for MPB exact-page SKU inventory text, bounded to 15 seconds, before collecting final evidence;
- keeps discovery pages fast and does not apply the inventory wait to generic discovery routes;
- retains out-of-stock pages for normal exact-page handling when no SKU appears;
- extracts MPB units with both the known strict layout and a bounded per-SKU parser, so harmless field-order/layout changes do not erase otherwise valid live inventory;
- preserves the existing manufacturer × selected-domain isolation rule unchanged.

Regression invariant:

- DJI × MPB remains valid;
- Sony × MPB remains valid;
- future manufacturers use the same source-level inventory readiness and SKU extraction without inheriting another manufacturer's URL pattern.


---

## Deep Source zero-product state contract — 7 September 2026

A Deep Source run is active only when `quote_catalog_ai_queue` contains at least one row for that run with status `queued`, `claimed` or `processing`.

`quote_catalog_ai_research_runs.status='queued'` by itself is insufficient to lock the dashboard. This prevents stale **DEEP AUDIT RUNNING · 0/0** displays.

Zero matching catalogue products follow this terminal path:

dashboard request
→ `quote-catalog-ai-worker`
→ `ai_research_create_deep_source_run(...)`
→ zero queue rows
→ run completed with `products_targeted=0`
→ Edge Function returns `no_matching_products`
→ dashboard remains ready to start another audit.

Cancellation also re-reads authoritative Deep Source state before invoking `ai_research_cancel_run`, so a stale browser-side run ID cannot target a completed or cancelled run.


## 7 September 2026 — Deep Source queue-count regression repair

The Deep Source Edge Function must read Supabase exact counts from the response `count` property, not `data`.

The failure was:

`select(..., { count: 'exact', head: true })`

was destructured as `data: count`. With `head: true`, data is null even when queue rows exist. The Edge Function therefore treated real one-product audits as zero-product audits and immediately marked the run `completed` while the Research PC could still claim the queued row.

The repaired path is:

Edge Function creates run and queue rows
→ reads `count: queueCount`
→ only zero rows become `no_matching_products` / `completed`
→ one or more rows remain `queued`
→ dashboard sees real queue-backed activity
→ targeted cancellation can mark the active run `cancelled`.

The affected 15:25 UTC Sony MPB run was reconciled to `cancelled` after confirming its only queue row was skipped and no work completed.

See: `docs/DEEP-SOURCE-WEBSITE-AUDIT-DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAP.md`.


## 7 September 2026 — Deep Source completion message repair

A completed Deep Source run correctly reset the **RUN DEEP SOURCE AUDIT** button, but the status message could remain on **Deep Source Audit running** until the browser was refreshed.

The database and queue lifecycle were already correct. The failure was isolated to `admin-ai-research.js`: when no active queue rows remained, `setDeepSourceAuditControls(null, [])` reset the controls but did not replace the old running message.

The dashboard now detects the transition from the browser-observed active run to its terminal database state and displays a completion, cancellation, error, or failure message. Historical runs are not re-announced after a page refresh.

See: `docs/DEEP-SOURCE-WEBSITE-AUDIT-DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAP.md`.


## 7 September 2026 — Sony MPB five-product finding audit

The completed Sony × MPB Deep Source run `7dc6d17f-d140-4ff4-9e3a-a658baf7d410` produced ten Pending Review candidates for five products. Independent audit accepted only one live pricing finding: **Sony VG-C4EM Vertical Grip** on the exact MPB UK page, with two live Excellent units at **£224**. The evidence was applied as **reference-only UK used-market evidence** so it does not alter automatic pricing.

The remaining nine candidates were denied because they were generic/ambiguous identities, duplicate aliases, out-of-stock/unpriced findings, or stale/non-canonical paths that did not contain usable live price evidence.

Important diagnostic finding: the active learning registry already contained the rule that generic catalogue taxonomy labels such as **Accessory** are not literal package variants. The accepted VG-C4EM candidate was nevertheless initially marked package/variant mismatch. This is now recorded as a candidate-scoring compliance issue to inspect before changing the Sony/DJI manufacturer-isolation rules.


---

## 7 September 2026 — Sony pending-evidence cleanup and package-identity hardening (1.5.14)

A historical Sony × MPB Pending Review backlog was audited after the earlier five-product run. **32 candidates** were reviewed against their exact catalogue targets and the preserved MPB evidence.

### Result

- **24 accepted and applied** as **reference-only UK used-market evidence**;
- **8 rejected** with explicit audit reasons;
- accepted evidence remains separate from automatic pricing;
- the FX2 Body Only candidate was corrected from a mixed model-page range to the verified **£2,129 Body Only** observation before application;
- lens-kit/bundle candidates were rejected where the generic model page did not positively prove the required package;
- duplicate VG-C4EM evidence was rejected because stronger evidence was already applied;
- out-of-stock/unpriced LA-EA5 and unpriced Alpha 1 II discovery paths were rejected.

### 1.5.14 Research PC rule

The first actual matching fault was in deepSourceTargetIdentity():

- a missing package phrase in a generic retailer title was being treated as a positive **mismatch**;
- the internal taxonomy label **Accessory** was not treated as generic in that code path.

The worker now:

1. treats **Accessory** as a generic taxonomy label rather than a literal retailer bundle;
2. treats explicit package identity as **exact**;
3. treats an explicit competing package suffix as **mismatch**;
4. treats a generic exact-model page that does not prove package identity as **uncertain**, preserving it for unit-level/manual verification rather than falsely rejecting it.

Release alignment is now:

- package 1.5.14
- worker 1.5.14-worker
- supervisor 1.5.14-supervisor

**Deployment requirement:** GitHub changes do not alter the running Research PC until the three files are deployed locally and the worker/supervisor is restarted. Before the next production batch, run syntax checks and verify the heartbeat release.


### Next research start checklist

1. Deploy the 1.5.14 Research PC files to the same folder the supervisor currently runs from.
2. Run node --check agent.mjs and node --check supervisor.mjs.
3. Run npm install only if dependencies changed or the local install is incomplete.
4. Start the supervisor and verify the database heartbeat/version.
5. Run **one Sony × MPB product** first.
6. Confirm generic exact model pages no longer create false package mismatches solely because Body Only/Accessory wording is absent.
7. Run one package-specific product and confirm a real competing bundle is still marked mismatch.
8. Only then start a larger batch.

# GitHub Desktop and Research PC Working-Copy Standard — 7 September 2026

## Authoritative code workflow

The authoritative source repository is:

`wmdroneservices/Action-Buyer-UK`

GitHub Desktop is the normal local source-control tool for the Research PC/development machine. The current verified working copy is:

`C:\\GearCashOut\\Action-Buyer-UK-GITHUB-CLEAN`

Do not treat the older extracted folder as a second active development repository.

## Secrets and configuration

Secrets remain outside GitHub in:

`C:\\GearCashOut-Config\\.env`

They must never be committed, copied into project memory, or added to GitHub.

The Research PC has verified that its configuration loads from the external config folder plus any non-secret repository configuration required by the worker.

## Gemma / Research PC path

The external Windows launcher resolves the active agent directory through:

`GEARCASHOUT_AGENT_DIR`

The verified current value points to:

`C:\\GearCashOut\\Action-Buyer-UK-GITHUB-CLEAN\\tools\\gear-ai-local-agent`

This is the path from which the supervisor and Gemma research worker are currently running successfully.

## Normal update procedure

1. Open GitHub Desktop.
2. Select the GearCashOut / Action-Buyer UK repository.
3. Fetch/Pull the latest `main` changes.
4. Review local changes before committing.
5. Commit only intended changes with a clear message.
6. Push the commit to GitHub.
7. If the pull changed `agent.mjs`, `supervisor.mjs`, `package.json` or other running Research PC files, restart the Research PC supervisor/worker so the new code is actually loaded.
8. Run a small real workflow test before a larger batch.

A GitHub pull updates files on disk; it does not automatically hot-reload a Node.js process that is already running.

## Verified end-to-end state

On 7 September 2026, the GitHub Desktop working copy was verified by:

- starting the supervisor from the GitHub working-copy agent folder;
- loading configuration from `C:\\GearCashOut-Config\\.env` plus repository configuration;
- confirming the Research PC became ready and polled normally;
- claiming and processing a real research job successfully.

Relevant diagnostic roadmap:

`docs/DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAPS/AI-RESEARCH-PC-CONTROL.md`


## Public Retail Storefront — Stage 1 foundation

A separate public website repository now exists:

`wmdroneservices/GearCashOut-Retail-Storefront`

It is a second website over the existing central Supabase platform, not a second catalogue or inventory database.

The public storefront currently uses the complete central buying catalogue:

`public.quote_catalog_products`

Current verified source size: **3,845 products across 73 manufacturers**.

Public catalogue reads are intentionally routed through safe RPCs:

- `public_storefront_manufacturers('retail')`
- `public_storefront_catalog('retail', ...)`

These expose only public presentation fields and availability counts. They do not expose buying prices, internal notes, customer data, staff data or market evidence.

Manufacturer/category/product visibility remains controlled by the existing `sales_catalog_visibility` model. All manufacturers are enabled by default through `auto`; management can explicitly hide a manufacturer without deleting catalogue data.

Relevant diagnostic roadmaps:

- Central backend: `docs/DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAPS/PHASE2-RETAIL-STOREFRONT.md`
- Public website: `GearCashOut-Retail-Storefront/docs/RETAIL-STOREFRONT-DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAP.md`


---

## Retail Storefront temporary identity — 7 September 2026

The separate Retail Storefront website remains connected to the shared GearCashOut platform and central catalogue. For design preview, it now uses **GearOutlet** as a temporary customer-facing name with the established GearCashOut four-point compass visual language.

- Repository: `wmdroneservices/GearCashOut-Retail-Storefront`
- Temporary asset: `images/gearoutlet-brand.svg`
- Final brand/domain: not yet chosen and remains configurable
- Backend impact: none; this change is presentation-only
- Diagnostic map: `docs/RETAIL-STOREFRONT-DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAP.md`


## Retail category hero imagery — first batch, 7 September 2026

The public Retail Storefront now has a separate editorial category-hero layer above catalogue results.

The first ten raw catalogue categories alphabetically are mapped to white/near-white stock imagery. The feature supports both category-only and manufacturer × category browsing, while keeping the hero imagery separate from product-card imagery and the central catalogue.

Technical path:

`shop.html` → `js/category-heroes.js` → `js/shop.js: renderCategoryHero()`

No Supabase product records, inventory, pricing or visibility controls are changed. Source/audit record:

`GearCashOut-Retail-Storefront/docs/CATEGORY-HERO-IMAGE-SOURCES.md`

Two first-batch visuals (Binocular Case and Body Camera) are documented as closest-match temporary white-background imagery and should be upgraded when a stronger exact-category stock source is found.


## Retail Storefront hero imagery — Batch 100 review, 7 September 2026

A review-only research batch of **100 hero-image candidates** has been added to the Retail Storefront before mass activation.

Composition:
- 50 catalogue categories;
- 25 manufacturers;
- 25 product lines.

Review entry point:

`GearCashOut-Retail-Storefront/hero-image-review.html`

Technical data:

`js/hero-image-review.js`

The candidates use researched stock/editorial source pages and are presented against the required white/near-white visual treatment. They are **not yet wired into live manufacturer/category/product-line filtering**, preserving the existing working storefront until review approval.

Source audit:

`docs/HERO-IMAGE-BATCH-100-REVIEW.md`

Relevant diagnostic roadmap:

`docs/RETAIL-STOREFRONT-DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAP.md`


## Corrected Retail hero-image methodology — 7 September 2026

The first generic Batch 100 review was rejected because its imagery was selected by broad category resemblance rather than from the products actually represented in the catalogue.

The replacement workflow is now catalogue-first:

`quote_catalog_products`
→ real manufacturer/category/product line/model group
→ representative catalogue product selected
→ manufacturer-specific/official image research
→ visual suitability review (recognisable product, clean white/light background, no generic substitute)
→ production hero mapping only after approval.

A corrected Batch 100 research manifest has been created in the Retail Storefront repository. It contains 100 real catalogue-derived targets and replaces the previous generic review methodology.


## Retail Storefront catalogue image population — 7 September 2026

The Retail Storefront product grid has entered visual population mode. Product cards now derive an image lookup identity from the actual live catalogue row (manufacturer + model + package/product context) rather than assigning generic category imagery.

The first implementation is deliberately non-destructive and front-end only: it does not alter `quote_catalog_products`, purchase pricing, evidence, stock, visibility controls or the existing buying/sales backend.

If a product-specific public image cannot be resolved, the card remains explicitly pending rather than being silently populated with an unrelated generic item. The next maintenance stage is to replace runtime lookup with a curated approved mapping/cache after visual coverage review.


## Image population fault and fix — 7 September 2026

**First failure:** the product card stored row JSON in an HTML data attribute after stripping quotation marks. The subsequent `JSON.parse` therefore failed before the product-image resolver could make any lookup.

**Minimal repair:** preserve the exact row JSON using URI encoding in the data attribute and decode it immediately before parsing. This changes only the image resolver handoff and does not alter catalogue, RPC, pricing, stock or sales logic.


## Catalogue-first homepage browsing — 7 September 2026

The homepage primary **Browse catalogue** action now takes the user to a category-first browsing section rather than immediately presenting an A–Z/all-products experience.

The homepage uses the main catalogue groupings, including Cameras, Lenses, Drones, Video Cameras, Action Cameras, Camera Accessories, Lighting, Audio, Supports & Stabilisation, Video Production Equipment, Drone Accessories, Power & Batteries and Studio Equipment.

Each category links into the existing central catalogue using the category query parameter. Manufacturer browsing remains available as a separate route and the underlying catalogue/RPC/backend remains unchanged.


## Correction: category cards must use the existing shop grid — 7 September 2026

The previous homepage category-first implementation was the wrong visual interpretation: it created a separate list/grid section rather than using the established Retail Storefront shop layout.

**Correct behaviour:** opening **Browse Catalogue** now keeps the exact shop page structure shown in the storefront: left filters and the existing card grid. The initial grid contains category cards (Cameras, Lenses, Drones, Video Cameras, Action Cameras, etc.) instead of individual products. Clicking a category then switches that same grid to the products within the selected category.

This is a front-end navigation/layout correction only. The central catalogue, manufacturer controls, Supabase RPCs, buying and sales backend remain unchanged.


## Retail browse hierarchy: Category → Manufacturer → Model → Live Stock — 7 September 2026

### User journey
The Retail Storefront now follows a hierarchical browse journey while preserving the existing sidebar and card-grid layout:

1. **Browse Categories** — category cards, each with a relevant hero image.
2. **Select Category** — only manufacturers relevant to that category are shown, each as an image card.
3. **Select Manufacturer** — models relevant to that manufacturer and category are shown as image cards.
4. **Select Model** — only actual units currently published to the WEBSITE outlet are shown as stock cards, with condition and asking price.

No category/manufacturer/model card requires a product-count number.

### Live data path
Category card
→ `public_storefront_category_manufacturers(store_key, category)`
→ manufacturer card
→ `public_storefront_models(store_key, category, manufacturer)`
→ model card
→ `public_storefront_stock(store_key, category, manufacturer, model)`
→ published WEBSITE resale listings joined to inventory assets and sales content.

### Safety and visibility
All new public RPCs are SECURITY DEFINER with fixed public search path and apply storefront visibility rules. Stock output deliberately excludes private fields such as serial numbers, storage locations, purchase prices and internal notes.

Only listings with **Published** status on the active **WEBSITE** outlet are exposed as live stock.

### Hero imagery
- Main category cards use explicit clean-background category hero mappings where available.
- Manufacturer, model and stock cards resolve imagery from the actual manufacturer/model identity rather than substituting unrelated generic objects.
- The selected hierarchy level also receives a relevant top hero.
- Curated catalogue/inventory sales imagery can replace runtime lookup as it is approved and populated.


## Image-system hard stop and curated replacement pipeline — 7 September 2026

### Fault identified
The live storefront was performing an unconstrained runtime Wikimedia search from manufacturer/model/category text. This could return semantically wrong media, including people, unrelated objects and duplicates. This was the first failure behind the poor card imagery.

### Immediate repair
- Removed the Wikimedia runtime image resolver completely.
- Removed runtime fallback searching from category, manufacturer, model and stock cards.
- Cleared the previous mixed hero mapping before replacement.
- Cards without an explicitly curated image now show a neutral **IMAGE CURATION — Approved image pending** state rather than an unrelated photograph.
- The 14 main storefront categories now have individually researched, explicit white-background/clean-background hero selections from Pexels research.

### Dedicated image queue
A new isolated Supabase table, `public.retail_storefront_image_queue`, was created so image research does not overwrite Gemma's evidence/catalogue work:

- 34 category targets
- 188 category/manufacturer targets
- 3,526 category/manufacturer/model targets
- 3,845 exact catalogue-product targets

Each target carries independent fields for source URL, source name, licence status, research status and explicit approval.

### Approval rule
Only an explicitly approved mapping may render. Candidate or unverified web results must never silently appear on the public storefront.

### Public access
`public_storefront_image_assets(category, manufacturer)` returns only approved rows with non-empty image URLs. Internal research notes and rejected/pending candidates remain private.

### Coordination rule
This queue is deliberately separate from `catalog_sales_content`, which is currently part of the shared research workflow. Do not overwrite or bulk-edit Gemma/other-agent catalogue evidence or sales-content records while this pipeline is being populated.


## Image Research ownership — 7 September 2026

Image research is a staff operation and belongs inside the Action-Buyer-UK Staff Dashboard → Research & Pricing area. Public outlet/storefront repositories are website-only and consume approved results; they do not contain staff research tools.


## Image Research — central staff ownership

**Diagnostic roadmap:** [Image Research and Sales-Channel Imagery](DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAPS/IMAGE-RESEARCH-AND-SALES-CHANNEL-IMAGERY.md)

Image research is a central staff operation. Use **Staff Dashboard → Research & Pricing → Image Research** in the `Action-Buyer-UK` repository to research and approve imagery for categories, manufacturers, models and exact catalogue products. Public outlet repositories remain website-only and consume approved results.


### 8 September 2026 — Manufacturer Batch Image Research

Image Research now includes a **Manufacturer Batch Research** mode in the Research & Pricing dashboard. The batch is intentionally based on the current authoritative key:

**Category + Manufacturer**

The workflow loads only entity_scope = manufacturer targets, so it supports the current priority of manufacturer/category coverage without restarting bulk exact-product imagery research.

A generated **Gemma Manufacturer Image Research Brief** supports controlled manual research from the selected manufacturer and exact queue categories. The AI Research Centre also provides the automated Gemma job path, which queues bounded Manufacturer + Category targets to the Research PC worker. Both paths preserve rights review and candidate-only deployment.

Server-side batch deployment validates the exact queue ID, manufacturer and category and refuses to overwrite approved imagery.

See: docs/DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAPS/IMAGE-RESEARCH-AND-SALES-CHANNEL-IMAGERY.md.


## Gemma manufacturer batch image research — 8 September 2026

The AI Research Centre now includes **Gemma Manufacturer Image Research** for controlled manufacturer batches. Select an existing canonical manufacturer and batch size; the job resolves only live central image-queue targets using the exact **Manufacturer + Category** key.

Flow:

AI Research Centre → create manufacturer job → Supabase job/items → Research PC `agent.mjs` → web discovery → Gemma validation → candidate write to `retail_storefront_image_queue` → staff rights/visual review → explicit approval → public sales-channel consumption.

New backend records:

- `retail_storefront_image_research_jobs`
- `retail_storefront_image_research_job_items`

Candidate research never sets `approved=true`. Existing approved imagery is not silently overwritten.

## Valuation photo upload cache repair — 8 September 2026

**Diagnostic roadmap:** `docs/DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAPS/CUSTOMER-VALUATION-AND-PHOTO-UPLOAD.md`

A customer valuation can require one or more photographs. The active upload path is:

`valuation.html`
→ `auth.js`
→ `quote-reverse-basket-v5.js`
→ `quote-submit-v4.js`
→ Supabase Storage bucket `quote-photos`
→ `create_customer_quotes(...)`
→ `valuations` + `quote_items.item_data.photos`.

The live Supabase bucket and RLS policies were verified on 8 September 2026, and a successful recent valuation already contained a stored photo. The backend was therefore not changed.

The first remaining failure point for a reported **Bucket not found** error was stale browser delivery of fixed-version JavaScript. `valuation.html` now requests:

- `auth.js?v=20260908-1`
- `quote-submit-v4.js?v=20260908-1`

This repair intentionally changes only browser cache identity for the active authentication and submission scripts. Do not recreate the bucket or weaken Storage RLS unless live backend checks identify a separate failure.

## Valuation photograph persistence repair — 8 September 2026

The next investigation showed a separate client-side failure after the earlier cache repair.

The valuation basket was persisted in `localStorage`, but selected browser `File` objects existed only in JavaScript memory. A navigation through login/register, refresh, or other full page reload could therefore restore the basket while leaving its photograph arrays empty. The final submit step then failed before any Supabase Storage request with **“Please add at least one actual photograph.”**

The active repair stores the basket photographs in browser `IndexedDB` under the same site origin:

- basket remains in `localStorage`;
- selected photographs are persisted when an item is added;
- photographs are restored when the valuation page loads and immediately before submission;
- persisted photographs are removed after a successful valuation;
- removing an item also updates the persisted photograph state.

Current active references:

- `quote-reverse-basket-v5.js?v=20260908-photo-persist-1`
- `quote-submit-v4.js?v=20260908-2`

This is a client-side continuity repair. It does not upload photographs before authentication and does not alter Supabase Storage or RLS.

## Purchasing Dashboard sales-handoff boundary — 8 September 2026

**Diagnostic roadmap:** `docs/DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAPS/INVENTORY-REPAIR-AND-SALES-WORKFLOW.md`

The shared **What Needs Doing** collector reads multiple workflow tables, but the Purchasing Dashboard now applies a presentation boundary at the Inventory → Sales handoff.

- **PURCHASING**, **PURCHASE RETURNS** and pre-handoff **INVENTORY** actions remain visible.
- **Ready for Resale** remains visible because staff still need to send the item into pre-sale.
- Once `inventory_assets.status` becomes **Sent to Sales**, the task is categorised as **SALES** and no longer appears on the Purchasing Dashboard.
- The Sales Dashboard remains responsible for pre-sale, listing, fulfilment and other sales actions.

The database status transition itself was already correct. The verified failure was that the shared task-board presentation showed **SALES** tasks on the Purchasing Dashboard after the handoff, making completed purchasing work appear to remain active there.

The repair is deliberately client-side presentation scoping in `live-task-board.js`; it does not alter inventory status, sales status or any workflow records.


---

## Live Task Board workspace ownership — 8 September 2026

The shared `live-task-board.js` collects authoritative workflow tasks centrally, but each staff dashboard must present only work owned by that workspace.

- **Purchasing Dashboard:** `PURCHASING`, `PURCHASE RETURNS`, `INVENTORY`
- **Sales Dashboard:** `SALES`, `CUSTOMER RETURNS`

This prevents completed handoffs from leaking back into the previous team's dashboard. Inventory remains on Purchasing until the item reaches **Sent to Sales**.

**Diagnostic Roadmap:** [Inventory Repair and Sales Workflow](DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAPS/INVENTORY-REPAIR-AND-SALES-WORKFLOW.md)

## Direct Website Publishing from the Sales Workbench — 8 September 2026

The **GearCashOut Retail Website** outlet is now a direct publishing channel. Staff enter the title, sale price and description in the Sales Workbench and use **PUBLISH TO WEBSITE**. The authoritative WEBSITE `resale_listings` record is published directly; no external marketplace URL is required.

The public storefront reads that published WEBSITE listing through the existing public storefront RPC path, so the same central inventory and sold-state controls remain in force. External marketplaces keep their separate Draft / Ready to Upload / live-link workflow.

**Diagnostic Roadmap:** `docs/DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAPS/PHASE2-RETAIL-STOREFRONT.md`.


## Unified Product Workbench and Sales Channels — 8 September 2026

### User action
Open an inventory asset. After it has been sent to Sales, continue using the same **Product Workbench** rather than opening a separate Sales Workbench.

### Current behaviour
The one product page now retains and manages:

- customer quote history and customer evidence;
- inspection and testing history;
- product details and condition;
- catalogue and physical-item sales content;
- staff photographs and hero-image selection;
- listing title, description, package contents and default sale price;
- all active sales outlets from sales_outlets.

The owned **WEBSITE** outlet publishes directly into the existing central resale_listings flow.

External marketplaces no longer require a Draft → Ready to Upload sequence. Staff create the marketplace listing externally, then use **ADD TO MARKETPLACE / MARK SUBMITTED** to record it as live in GearCashOut. Existing central sold handling remains available from the same channel area.

listing-readiness.html is retained as a compatibility route but redirects to inventory-detail.html.

### Customer condition / exception notes
Customer condition or exception notes are displayed explicitly in the Customer Quote section. They are no longer shown only underneath the damage card, which previously made condition notes easy to miss or misleadingly associated with damage.

### Diagnostic roadmap
See:

docs/DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAPS/INVENTORY-REPAIR-AND-SALES-WORKFLOW.md

## Unified Product Workbench correction — 8 September 2026

### What staff use

Each physical item is managed through one authoritative per-item page:

`inventory-detail.html?id=<asset_id>`

The page is intended to work like a single listing editor: product details, condition, package, inspection/testing, photographs, resale description, sale price, item sales presentation, catalogue content, history and all sales channels remain accessible from the same product page.

A separate **Product History** link scrolls to the retained purchase, acquisition, inspection and repair record.

### Sales channels

- **GearCashOut Retail Website**: publish directly from the product page.
- **External marketplaces/channels**: create the listing externally, then use one submitted/live action to record it.
- There is no Draft → Ready to Upload requirement in the normal operational flow.
- Central `resale_listings` remains the authoritative channel record.

### Root cause corrected

The first actual failure in the previous consolidation was a schema mismatch: `inventory-sales-channels.js` attempted to save `listing_title` onto `inventory_assets`, but the live `inventory_assets` table has no such column. Listing titles belong to `resale_listings`.

A second issue was presentation architecture: the sales handoff script replaced the entire Product Workbench DOM for sales-status items, effectively recreating a second workbench. It now appends sales/history sections to the same page instead.

### Diagnostic route

User opens product
→ `inventory-detail.html`
→ `inventory-workbench.js` for core editable product and inspection data
→ `inventory-sales-handoff.js` for retained history, sales presentation and staff photo management
→ `inventory-sales-channels.js` for WEBSITE and external channel controls
→ `inventory_assets`, `inventory_testing`, `inventory_repairs`, `inventory_evidence`, `inventory_sales_content`, `catalog_sales_content`, `sales_outlets`, `resale_listings`.

**Diagnostic Roadmap:** `docs/DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAPS/INVENTORY-REPAIR-AND-SALES-WORKFLOW.md`.

### Verification state

Repository code syntax was checked after the correction. Live browser workflow verification remains required for:

1. editing and saving one Sent to Sales item;
2. adding/removing/viewing staff photographs;
3. publishing the WEBSITE outlet;
4. recording one external marketplace as submitted/live;
5. confirming the public storefront and sales dashboard reflect the same central listing.


### Condition-note fallback repair

Customer condition/exception notes are now also checked against the matching item inside `valuations.quote_data.quoteBasket`. This covers older or multi-item submissions where the item-level copy is incomplete but the original valuation basket still contains the note.


---

## Final Product Workbench listing stage — 8 September 2026

For an asset in a Sales handoff status, `inventory-detail.html` remains the single per-item workspace, but the page changes from inspection work into a concise final-listing stage.

### Read-only history

The final listing stage shows original customer condition and note, condition after inspection, inspection result, **TESTED / INSPECTED** when a recorded inspection/testing row exists, the staff member and date recorded against the inspection/testing record, and price paid marked **reference only**.

The active inspection/testing form is removed from the Sales handoff presentation. `inventory_testing` remains the historical source and is not rewritten by listing work.

### Master listing details

Staff save one shared set of listing details: manufacturer/product description from `catalog_sales_content.product_description` where available, editable individual listing description, listing title, sale price and postage/packing.

The shared title, price and postage/packing are stored on `inventory_sales_content`; existing asset description and approved resale price remain synchronised for compatibility.

### Photographs and channels

Staff can view, add, remove and choose the individual-item hero photograph on the same page. Customer evidence remains separate from staff listing photographs.

**WEBSITE is first** and publishes directly through the existing `Published` `resale_listings` path. Marketplaces follow underneath with a single **ADD TO MARKETPLACE** action that records the channel as submitted/live. There is no normal Draft or Ready to Upload step.

### Diagnostic route

`inventory-detail.html` → `inventory-workbench.js` → `inventory-sales-handoff.js` → `inventory_sales_content` / `catalog_sales_content` / `inventory_evidence` → `inventory-sales-channels.js` → `sales_outlets` / `resale_listings` → public storefront.

### Verification state

Current scripts were syntax-checked and the live Supabase schema was verified after migration. Real browser end-to-end verification remains required.

# Current Restore Point — 8 September 2026, 19:31 BST

## Restore purpose

This checkpoint preserves the system immediately before the next material redesign of the sales flow.

## Verified current state

- Customer valuation flow has been repaired sufficiently to submit and produce a valuation reference.
- Quote-photo handling was repaired after the browser reported missing/bucket issues; submitted photographs are now visible in staff/admin review.
- Purchasing Dashboard leakage was corrected so sales-stage items are no longer intentionally shown as purchasing work items.
- Sales Dashboard/Workbench has been introduced and is currently handling inventory, pre-sale/listing and sales-stage work.
- A Product Workbench exists, creating overlap and user confusion with the Sales Workbench.
- The current repository head is commit `9e1520baa0df3c9245e1b19c3b635e0eab950455` with message **Add final Product Workbench listing stage checkpoint**.
- The next requested change is not a cosmetic patch: consolidate the operational listing workflow so one workbench is the clear place to edit product details, descriptions and photographs and manage website/marketplace submission.

## Newly reported behaviour to inspect first

1. Some items have a condition note that is not displaying.
2. The distinction between **Sales Workbench** and **Product Workbench** is confusing and duplicates editing responsibility.
3. The desired workflow is one operational listing page where staff can:
   - edit all item/product details;
   - view existing photographs;
   - edit/remove/replace/add photographs;
   - edit descriptions and other listing data;
   - alter any required listing details in one place;
   - see the sales channels below the editable product section;
   - send directly to the new GearCashOut website without a draft-first requirement;
   - mark/send marketplace listings directly with a simple explicit action such as **Add to Marketplace** or **Submitted**.

## Intended workflow direction — do not implement blindly

The next session must inspect the current code and Supabase schema before deciding which existing workbench becomes the single source of truth. The likely design goal is:

**Inventory item → one unified listing/workbench editor → Save changes → Website: Send to Website → Marketplaces: Add to Marketplace / Submitted status**

No duplicate draft-first workflow should be retained unless a real external integration technically requires an internal preparation state.

## Required investigation order

**Memory/checkpoint → relevant Diagnostic Roadmap → current GitHub → current Supabase → first actual failure → previous fixes → minimal safe redesign → test → verify → update both manuals and project-memory checkpoint.**

## Git restore anchor

Dedicated restore branch:

`restore/sales-flow-checkpoint-2026-09-08-1931`

Base commit:

`9e1520baa0df3c9245e1b19c3b635e0eab950455`


## Condition truth in Inventory and Sales — 8 September 2026

Two condition records have different purposes and must never be merged:

- **Customer-declared condition** (`customer_condition` and customer exception notes) is historical valuation information and is reference-only after receipt.
- **Staff inspection condition** (`inventory_assets.condition_grade`, with inspection/testing evidence) is the authoritative resale condition.

Only the staff inspection condition may be carried into Product Workbench sales presentation, `resale_listings.listing_data.condition`, the GearCashOut retail listing, or marketplace listing data. Customer-declared condition and notes remain visible only in the controlled historical/reference area.


## Final Product Workbench listing flow — 8 September 2026

The final Product Workbench is the single operational listing editor. The operator should only complete or correct the resale information that matters at listing stage:

- pre-filled editable listing title;
- manufacturer/product description where catalogue data exists;
- item-specific resale description;
- detailed staff condition description;
- battery quantity;
- missing parts/items;
- exact package contents;
- sale price;
- postage and packing;
- listing photographs.

After saving, the operator can **Send to Website** or **Add to Marketplace** from the channel list below. There is no draft workflow.

When a listing is marked sold, the database function marks all other active channel records as Delist Required. The GearCashOut website automatically stops displaying its listing because the public storefront only returns Published WEBSITE listings. External marketplaces currently have no configured closure APIs, so the workbench must show a clear manual closure warning rather than claiming they were automatically closed.


## Unified final sales page — 8 September 2026

For an item already sent to Sales, the Product Workbench is the single operational listing page. Staff complete only the practical listing information:

- pre-filled manufacturer/product description, editable if required;
- staff description of the exact item;
- detailed staff resale condition;
- missing parts/items;
- battery count;
- customer photographs and staff inspection photographs, with an explicit **Use for sale listing** choice;
- additional photographs;
- sale price;
- postage and packing.

The workbench saves selected sale photograph paths in inventory_sales_content.listing_photo_paths. Customer valuation photographs remain historical source records and are never deleted merely because they are not selected for sale.

Below the editor, the WEBSITE action publishes directly. Other active outlets appear below as Add to Marketplace actions. Marking one listing sold uses staff_mark_resale_listing_sold, which marks all other active listings Delist Required; the WEBSITE listing immediately disappears from public stock because the public storefront exposes only Published WEBSITE listings. External channels currently have no configured closure API and therefore require manual closure warnings rather than a false claim of automatic closure.


### Item-specific manufacturer text safeguard
Manufacturer/product description can be pre-filled from catalog_sales_content, but saving an individual Product Workbench listing now stores the edited text only on inventory_sales_content. An item-level correction must not overwrite the shared catalogue description for every future item of that model.


## 8 September 2026 — Published website status and duplicate workflow-strip repair

### First actual findings

The live Supabase record for TEST-ASSET-003 is a Published WEBSITE resale listing, and public_storefront_stock('retail', ...) returns it as live public stock. The backend publishing path was therefore not the failure.

The staff page could still leave the operator uncertain because the final listing stage did not place a prominent top-level live confirmation above the channel actions. The unified channel panel now explicitly shows **WEBSITE STATUS: LIVE ON GEARCASHOUT** when the authoritative resale_listings row is Published.

For sales-stage assets, the base Product Workbench's earlier inspection workflow strip was still left in the header while the final sales handoff owned the page. That produced two competing workflow guides. The obsolete inspection strip is now removed for sales handoff mode.

The customer valuation page's progress indicator also used forced horizontal scrolling on desktop, leaving a scrollbar/track that could look like a second progress tree. It now wraps normally into one progress guide.

### Regression rule

Do not change a live WEBSITE listing back to Draft merely to repair presentation. Verify resale_listings.status, then verify public_storefront_stock before touching the publishing backend.


## 8 September 2026 — Sales Dashboard active-listing truth repair

### First verified failure

A WEBSITE listing can be genuinely **Published** while its physical `inventory_assets.status` remains **Sent to Sales**. This is the current state of `TEST-ASSET-003`.

The public storefront and Active Sales / Listings page already read `resale_listings.status='Published'`, but the Sales Dashboard pipeline was incorrectly counting only physical assets with `status='Listed'` or `status='Reserved'`.

Result: a genuinely live website listing could appear as:

- 0 Listed;
- 0 Active Listings;
- still included in Ready for Pre-Sale.

### Repair

The Sales Dashboard now uses authoritative `resale_listings` state for the active pipeline:

- Published channel row → active/listed;
- Reserved channel row → reserved;
- Sent to Sales is excluded from Ready for Pre-Sale when that asset already has a Published or Reserved channel listing.

This deliberately avoids changing a working Published listing or forcing an unnecessary physical-asset status rewrite.

### Verification rule

When dashboard and storefront disagree:

1. inspect the asset status;
2. inspect `resale_listings` for Published/Reserved rows;
3. count active sales from channel rows;
4. only then consider changing the asset lifecycle state.

Do not "repair" the dashboard by changing a Published listing back to Draft or by blindly rewriting inventory status.


## 8 September 2026 — Single listing-workbench CTA

### Verified duplication

The Pre-Sale / Channels cards showed both:

- **OPEN SALES WORKBENCH** → `listing-readiness.html?id=<asset_id>` → compatibility redirect;
- **PRODUCT WORKBENCH** → `inventory-detail.html?id=<asset_id>`.

Both routes ultimately served the same unified Product Workbench responsibility.

### Repair

Pre-Sale / Channels now exposes one CTA only:

**OPEN PRODUCT WORKBENCH** → `inventory-detail.html?id=<asset_id>`.

The compatibility redirect remains available for old bookmarks and legacy links, but it is no longer presented as a second operational choice.

### Rule

One physical product has one operational listing editor and one visible listing-workbench action.


## 8 September 2026 — Existing live listing continuity repair

### First actual issue

A product can already have a valid Published WEBSITE row while having no `inventory_sales_content` row. This is the case for legacy/test stock such as `TEST-ASSET-003`.

Without a fallback, the unified Product Workbench could show blank listing fields and an update action could incorrectly require staff to recreate title/price information that already existed in `resale_listings`.

### Repair

The unified Product Workbench now treats the existing channel listing as a safe read-only fallback when item-level sales content has not yet been created:

- existing listing title pre-fills the workbench identity;
- existing asking price pre-fills the sale price;
- existing shipping cost pre-fills postage where available;
- existing listing description is retained as a fallback description;
- item-level `inventory_sales_content` still becomes the preferred source after the operator saves.

The same fallback is used when updating a channel listing.

### Rule

Do not make staff recreate a working live listing merely because it predates the unified Product Workbench. Preserve existing `resale_listings` data and allow the unified editor to adopt it safely.


## 8 September 2026 — Active Sales visibility RLS repair

### First actual failure

The Sales Dashboard JavaScript had already been corrected to count authoritative `resale_listings.status='Published'` rows.

However, `resale_listings` had Row Level Security enabled with no staff SELECT policy. The database therefore returned no listing rows to an authenticated staff browser, even though privileged database inspection and the public storefront could see the Published listing.

This explains why the dashboard could still show **0 Listed / No Active Listings** after the JavaScript counting repair.

### Minimal repair

Added the `resale_listings_sales_staff_select` RLS policy.

A row is visible to an authenticated user only when there is an active `staff_users` record and the user has either:

- `can_access_sales = true`; or
- `can_manage_staff = true`.

### Verified result

An authenticated eligible sales staff context can now read the two current Published resale rows. The dashboard's existing authoritative listing-count logic can therefore receive the live rows it was already designed to count.

No listing status, inventory status, storefront record or published item was changed.


---

## 8 September 2026 — Unified Sales Stream: Ready to List → Active Listings → Sold Items

### Purpose
The sales area now uses one operational stream. A physical asset may remain `Sent to Sales` while its channel record is already live, so page placement must be determined by authoritative `resale_listings` state rather than by repeatedly interpreting the physical status.

### User path
**Inventory → Ready to List → Active Listings → Sold Items → Returns**

### Authoritative placement rules

- **Ready to List:** `inventory_assets.status='Sent to Sales'` and no `resale_listings.status` of `Published` or `Reserved`.
- **Active Listings:** one or more `resale_listings` rows are `Published` or `Reserved`.
- **Sold Items:** the central sold workflow has moved the asset into a post-sale status, including `Sold - Awaiting Shipping`, `Sold - Shipped` or return handling.
- **Delist Required:** an outstanding external closure warning can remain visible as an urgent exception without putting the product back into the normal ready-to-list queue.

### Developer Diagnostic Roadmap
See: `docs/DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAPS/INVENTORY-REPAIR-AND-SALES-WORKFLOW.md`.

### First verified failure and repair
The Sales Dashboard had already been repaired to exclude live `Published/Reserved` assets from its ready-to-list count, but `inventory-sales.js` still treated every `Sent to Sales` asset as pre-sale work. This created the contradictory state where a product could be live in Active Listings and still appear in the listing queue.

The repair keeps the existing database model and filters the queue using the same authoritative channel truth. No live listing, inventory status or storefront record was rewritten.


---

## 8 September 2026 — Operational Data Reset

The management reset is the deliberate clean-start route for development workflow data.

It removes all current operational workflow records, including:

- valuations and quote items;
- offers, refusals and offer events;
- sales and sale items;
- inventory assets and their dependent preparation/testing/repair/evidence/sales-content records;
- resale listings and resale transactions;
- fulfilment and sales-customer-return records;
- customer return workflow records;
- queued workflow emails;
- workflow photographs in the `quote-photos` storage bucket.

It deliberately preserves:

- customer and staff accounts;
- catalogue products and research evidence;
- pricing rules and retailer data;
- outlet configuration;
- system configuration and project documentation.

### Reset safety finding

The earlier reset function already removed most workflow records, but live data contained `sales_fulfillments` and `sales_customer_returns` rows with restrictive foreign keys to `inventory_assets`. Those rows could block inventory deletion.

The reset now deletes those blockers before the inventory layer, allowing the clean-start reset to complete in the correct dependency order.

**Important:** the reset was repaired and documented here, but it was not executed as part of the repair.


## Receipt to Inspection Continuity Repair — 8 September 2026

A fresh operational reset exposed an important handoff dependency: physical receipt must leave behind the authoritative `inventory_assets` row that inspection, testing, photographs, repairs and Sales all use.

The receipt RPC previously only updated an existing `Awaiting Receipt` asset. After a clean operational reset there could be no such asset, allowing a sale to enter inspection without inventory. The repaired receipt workflow now creates the linked asset at **Received** when it is missing and returns separate created/updated/total counts.

Diagnostic Roadmap: `docs/DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAPS/INVENTORY-REPAIR-AND-SALES-WORKFLOW.md`.

The Product Workbench also now shows a visible error/timeout instead of remaining indefinitely on its loading message.

## Purchasing Inspection → Read-Only Sales Boundary — 8 September 2026

The physical inspection is owned by **Purchasing**.

Required route:

**Received** → **Start Inspection** → editable `inventory-detail.html` Product Workbench in Purchasing → inspection/testing outcome → **Repair Required** or completed physical inspection → Sales sees the inspection as **read-only** → final offer/refusal becomes available only after the physical inspection is complete.

Sales must not edit inspection facts, technical test results, repair details or physical condition history. Those records remain editable only through the Purchasing/Product Workbench and the controlled Repair Required workflow.

The Sales sale-detail page now links an incomplete inspection back to Purchasing rather than bypassing it to the final-offer screen. When complete, Sales shows a read-only inspection summary and then exposes the final-offer/refusal action.

The final-offer control layer also verifies the linked inventory asset has completed the Purchasing inspection before re-enabling accepted-item final-offer controls.

Diagnostic Roadmap: `docs/DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAPS/INVENTORY-REPAIR-AND-SALES-WORKFLOW.md`.

## Duplicate Inspection Task Prevention — 8 September 2026

A received item can have both a **sale record** and its linked **inventory asset**, but this must not create two staff actions for the same physical inspection.

The unified Live Task Board now treats the linked inventory asset as the authoritative inspection task once it exists:

- the sale-side “Inspect received item” task is suppressed;
- the single Inventory Product Workbench task remains;
- the underlying valuation, sale and asset records are not duplicated.

This prevents the Purchasing Dashboard from making one physical item look like two separate valuations or inspections.


---

## Customer purchase finalisation gate before Sales — 8 September 2026

**Diagnostic roadmap:** [Inventory Repair and Sales Workflow](DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAPS/INVENTORY-REPAIR-AND-SALES-WORKFLOW.md)

A customer-sourced item can be physically ready after inspection/testing but must **not** enter the Sales/listing stream until the purchase from the customer is finalised. The authoritative `staff_send_inventory_to_sales(...)` gate now requires the linked `sales` record to be `status='completed'` and `payment_status='paid'` before the asset can move from `Ready for Resale` to `Sent to Sales`.

This is enforced in the database as well as the Product Workbench. “Ready for Resale” means physically ready; it does not by itself mean commercially cleared for resale.


## Receipt status authority — 2026-09-08

When staff confirm **ITEM RECEIVED**, the authoritative action is the secured Supabase RPC `staff_mark_item_received_and_sync_inventory`. It updates the purchase to `received`, marks the inbound shipment delivered and synchronises the linked inventory asset. Customer-facing pages must treat the purchase status as authoritative after receipt; a stale `shipments.status='in_transit'` must never overwrite the customer update.

See: [Inventory Repair, Testing and Sales Handoff Diagnostic Roadmap](DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAPS/INVENTORY-REPAIR-AND-SALES-WORKFLOW.md).


## Customer Account — Read-only Original Valuation

Customers can now open a read-only copy of what they originally submitted, including product identity, package, customer-declared condition, missing-item/exceptions information and submitted photographs where available.

The customer account surfaces **VIEW WHAT YOU SENT** links from both valuation records and active valuation/purchase updates. The link opens:

- `customer-valuation.html?id=<valuation-id>`
- rendered by `customer-valuation.js`
- link injection owned by `account-valuation-view-links.js`.

The page is deliberately historical and read-only. It must show the customer's original submission rather than replacing it with staff inspection or resale information.

**Developer Diagnostic Roadmap:** `docs/DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAPS/CUSTOMER-VALUATION-AND-PHOTO-UPLOAD.md`

**Security boundary:** the page queries the valuation with both the requested ID and the authenticated customer's `user_id`, with existing RLS on `valuations` and `quote_items` enforcing ownership. Do not convert this into a public unauthenticated valuation URL.

## Receipt failure: UUID catalogue resolver — 2026-09-08

A live receipt test showed that the button could reach the authoritative receipt RPC while every operational record remained unchanged. The first database failure was inside `resolve_quote_item_catalog_product(...)`, which used PostgreSQL `min(id)` on a UUID column. PostgreSQL has no `min(uuid)`, so the exception rolled back the entire receipt transaction before sale, shipment or inventory updates could persist.

The resolver now uses `(array_agg(id))[1]` and returns that UUID only when exactly one catalogue match exists. The receipt RPC was transactionally retested successfully, then the affected live sale was repaired through the same authoritative RPC and verified as `sales.status=received → inbound shipment=delivered → inventory asset=Received`.

See: [Inventory Repair, Testing and Sales Handoff Diagnostic Roadmap](DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAPS/INVENTORY-REPAIR-AND-SALES-WORKFLOW.md).
## Receipt gate and customer valuation visibility — 8 September 2026

### Receipt rule

The **ITEM RECEIVED** action is not a generic shortcut.

Required sequence:

**accepted purchase → customer → GearCashOut shipping label/QR created and sent → item posted/in transit → staff marks item received → Purchasing inspection**

Both layers enforce this:

- `admin-sales.js` only shows **ITEM RECEIVED** when an inbound shipment has a recorded label/QR;
- `staff_mark_item_received_and_sync_inventory(uuid)` rejects receipt if that inbound shipping evidence does not exist.

This prevents an item being received before the customer has been given the shipping label.

### Customer account rule

A valuation remains visible as **in progress** while its linked customer purchase is still active. The customer sees:

- the count of valuations currently in progress;
- the product/reference originally submitted;
- the separate live purchasing/valuation update.

The sale remains authoritative for receipt, inspection and payment status; the valuation view preserves visibility of what the customer originally sent.

**Diagnostic roadmap:** [Inventory, Repair and Sales Workflow](DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAPS/INVENTORY-REPAIR-AND-SALES-WORKFLOW.md)


## Final offer and Sales handoff rendering boundary — 8 September 2026

A published **final offer** is a customer decision state, not another generic inspection update.

The customer account now has one authoritative standalone final-offer renderer in `account-page.js`. The previous competing `account-single-offer-visibility.js` include was removed because independent polling could briefly show the final price and then overwrite it with the older inspection message or duplicate cards.

For a published final offer:

- the customer sees the exact product and final price;
- **ACCEPT FINAL OFFER** and **REFUSE** remain available through the existing secure offer RPCs;
- the generic **valuation in progress** card for that same item is suppressed;
- shipping helpers do not overwrite receipt/inspection/final-offer state.

**Diagnostic roadmap:** [Inventory Repair and Sales Workflow](DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAPS/INVENTORY-REPAIR-AND-SALES-WORKFLOW.md)

### Ready for Resale is not permission to enter Sales

For customer-sourced inventory, **Ready for Resale** means the physical inspection/testing workflow is complete. It does not mean the purchase is commercially finalised.

Before the linked customer purchase is `completed` and `paid`:

- Product Workbench shows **WAITING FOR PURCHASE FINALISATION** instead of **SEND TO SALES**;
- the Live Task Board suppresses the premature pre-sale task;
- the database RPC remains the final enforcement boundary.

This keeps the same physical asset from appearing as both **waiting for final offer** and **ready to send to Sales**.


---

## Live retail product page and photographs — 8 September 2026

**Developer roadmap:** [Phase 2 Retail Storefront](DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAPS/PHASE2-RETAIL-STOREFRONT.md)

A published WEBSITE listing now has a public product-detail route and can show the photographs explicitly selected for that listing.

### Flow

`Product Workbench → inventory_sales_content.listing_photo_paths → resale_listings (WEBSITE, Published) → public_storefront_stock → GearOutlet stock card → product.html?listing=<listing_id>`

The original `quote-photos` bucket remains private. It must not be made public because it also contains customer submission material. The public website therefore requests only the paths already selected for a published WEBSITE listing through the secure `public-listing-media` Edge Function, which validates the listing state and returns short-lived signed image URLs.

Public detail data comes from:

- `public_storefront_listing('retail', listing_id)`
- `public-listing-media` Edge Function

The public detail route exposes listing presentation only and does not expose purchase cost, serial number, storage location, customer details or internal notes.

## 9 September 2026 — Customer valuation taxonomy normalisation

### Verified issue

The public valuation wizard was loading the raw catalogue taxonomy directly from `quote_catalog_products`. The live catalogue contains historical/imported source categories from multiple feeds, so customers could see overlapping choices such as:

- **Drone** and **Drones**;
- **Lighting**, **Continuous Lighting**, **Studio Lighting** and **Photography Lighting & Studio**;
- other closely related camera, support and video groups.

The existing dropdown guard removed only exact duplicate option identities. It could not resolve semantically overlapping source categories.

### Minimal repair

The underlying catalogue records were **not renamed or merged**. Instead, the customer valuation wizard now maps raw categories into one stable public taxonomy:

- **Drones**
- **Action Cameras**
- **Cameras**
- **Lenses & Accessories**
- **Video Equipment**
- **Audio Equipment**
- **Other Equipment** only for genuine unmatched catalogue records

This preserves catalogue/research history while preventing customers from having to choose between competing singular/plural or overlapping source categories.

Product types remain derived from the selected public category and are deduplicated by normalised display identity.

**Known fault history (9 September 2026):** normalised display identity alone did not merge semantic variants such as `Drone`/ `Camera Drones` and `Drone Controllers`/ `Drone Remote Controllers`. The repair is the context-aware product-type alias layer in `quote-reverse-basket-v5.js`, and that same canonical identity must be used by both the dropdown and exact product lookup.

### Developer Diagnostic Roadmap — Start Your Valuation category dropdown

**User action:** Open `valuation.html` and select a Category, then Product type.

**Expected result:** Customer sees the stable public taxonomy rather than raw imported catalogue categories.

**Website / front end:**

`valuation.html`
→ `customer-catalog-visibility.js` applies the customer-visible catalogue guard
→ `quote-reverse-basket-v5.js`
→ loads active customer-visible `quote_catalog_products`
→ `canonicalMainCategory(...)`
→ Category dropdown
→ Product type dropdown
→ Manufacturer
→ Model
→ Package
→ `findProduct()` resolves the selected product using the canonical public category plus the raw product identity.

**Supabase:**

- `quote_catalog_products`
- relevant fields: `active`, `customer_visible`, `main_category`, `category`, `product_type`, `manufacturer`, `model`, `package_key`, `package_name`.

No catalogue rows are rewritten by the customer-facing taxonomy layer.

**Failure checkpoints:**

1. Confirm the customer-visible query returns rows.
2. Confirm `active=true` and `customer_visible=true`.
3. Inspect raw `main_category/category/product_type` values.
4. Inspect `canonicalMainCategory(...)` in `quote-reverse-basket-v5.js`.
5. Confirm `productTypes()` and `scopedProducts()` use the same canonical category rule.
6. Confirm `findProduct()` still resolves the exact catalogue product after grouping.
7. If an old dropdown remains visible, confirm the cache-busted script version in `valuation.html`.

### Regression rule

Do not solve future customer dropdown duplication by blindly merging or renaming live catalogue records. Preserve the research/catalogue source taxonomy unless a separate controlled data-normalisation project is carried out. The public valuation taxonomy and the internal catalogue taxonomy are intentionally allowed to differ.

## Purchase Catalogue → Sales / Retail Category Routing — audited 9 September 2026

The buying catalogue remains authoritative. Source categories are preserved because they contain historical/imported taxonomy used by research and product identity. Public retail navigation must not require those raw variants to be manually duplicated in every website.

The retail route is now:

quote_catalog_products
→ canonical_storefront_category(...)
→ public_storefront_categories(...)
→ public_storefront_category_manufacturers(...)
→ public_storefront_models(...)
→ public_storefront_stock(...).

This gives every catalogue product a route into one stable retail category without renaming or merging the underlying purchase catalogue.

The relevant Developer Diagnostic Roadmap is: docs/DIAGNOSTIC-ROADMAPS/PHASE2-RETAIL-STOREFRONT.md.


## Customer Valuation Taxonomy — semantic duplicate repair (9 September 2026)

The public valuation wizard must not expose semantically duplicated catalogue labels merely because historical/imported source taxonomy differs.

The customer-facing alias layer in `quote-reverse-basket-v5.js` now merges, within the relevant public group:

- `Drone` / `Drones` / `Camera Drone(s)` → **Camera Drones**
- `Drone Controller(s)` / `Drone Remote Controller(s)` / legacy `Remote Controller(s)` → **Drone Controllers**
- overlapping broad lighting labels including `Continuous Lighting`, `Photography Lighting`, `Studio Lighting`, `Flexible RGB Light`, `RGB Tube Light` and `Streaming Light` → **Lighting**

Exact catalogue resolution is preserved because the same canonical product-type identity is used when filtering products and finding the selected product.

### Verification route

`valuation.html` → `quote-reverse-basket-v5.js` → public taxonomy aliasing → scoped catalogue rows → manufacturer/model/package → exact catalogue product.

The database taxonomy was not rewritten for this repair.


## Product Workbench: completed inspection next action — 9 September 2026

After a customer-owned item has been received and its physical inspection/testing is complete, the Product Workbench now keeps staff in the Purchasing workflow.

The navigation is contextual:

- **PURCHASING DASHBOARD** is the normal return route.
- When the item is **Ready for Resale** but the linked customer purchase is still awaiting its final offer, the page shows **OPEN CUSTOMER FINAL OFFER**.
- The workflow step is shown as **Final offer & payment**, not **Send to Sales**.
- The existing Sales handoff remains available only after the customer has accepted the final offer and payment has been completed.

This prevents staff from being sent into the Sales area while the item is still part of an unfinished customer purchase.


A final-offer button is not shown merely because an asset is **Ready for Resale**. The linked purchase must actually be awaiting the final offer. Once the offer has been accepted and the workflow has moved to payment, the Product Workbench no longer reopens the final-offer action.


## Customer offer acceptance idempotency — 9 September 2026

A live database audit found that the repository already contained the idempotent customer-offer acceptance migration, but the production Supabase migration history did not include it. The live `accept_quote_offer` function was therefore still rejecting a second request for an offer that had already been accepted with **Offer is not available for acceptance**.

The live function has now been brought into line with the intended migration. Repeating acceptance of the same customer-owned offer now returns a successful `already_accepted` result rather than an error. Genuine unavailable offers remain protected.


## Completed purchase → Sales handoff boundary — 9 September 2026

**Live incident:** a DJI Mini 5 Pro had completed inspection, the customer had been paid, and the asset had been successfully moved to `Sent to Sales`, but the completed purchase still appeared under **ACTIVE PURCHASES** with **NO ACTION REQUIRED**.

**First actual failure:** `admin-purchasing.html` reuses `admin-sales.js`, and that shared controller loaded every unarchived sale. It did not distinguish a completed purchasing record from an active purchasing workflow record.

**Live state verified:**

- asset: `GCO-AEAA94E839`;
- asset status: `Sent to Sales`;
- previous status: `Ready for Resale`;
- `sent_to_sales_at` populated;
- linked purchase status: `completed`;
- payment status: `paid`.

The database handoff was already correct. The defect was presentation/query filtering.

**Repair:** on the Purchasing Dashboard, `admin-sales.js` now treats `paid`, `completed` and `cancelled` as terminal purchase states:

- **ACTIVE PURCHASES** shows only unfinished purchases;
- **PURCHASE ARCHIVE** shows terminal purchase history;
- terminal purchases are not given Sales archive/restore/delete controls from the Purchasing page;
- Purchasing navigation remains on Purchasing URLs rather than being rewritten to Sales URLs.

No database state, RPC, trigger or RLS policy was changed.


## Staff top-bar GearCashOut logo routing — corrected 9 September 2026

The GearCashOut logo on every **staff** page returns to the central **Staff Dashboard**:

`admin.html`

This is intentional because the Staff Dashboard reads the signed-in staff member's permissions from `staff_users` and shows only the dashboards and management areas that staff member is authorised to access.

The logo must therefore **not guess a workflow dashboard** from the current page. For example, a staff member working in Inventory must not automatically be sent to Sales if their authorised dashboard access is different.

- shared staff-navigation pages → logo forced to `admin.html`;
- static/special staff pages → logo explicitly points to `admin.html`;
- public customer pages remain separate and are not changed by this rule.

The shared control point is `staff-navigation.js`, and its cache version must be refreshed on pages that load it.


## Purchasing inbound-label confirmation — 9 September 2026

### User action

Staff create and email the **Customer → GearCashOut** shipping label.

### Required outcome

After a successful inbound label save **and successful customer email**, Purchasing must not present Inventory as the next destination.

The confirmation now shows:

- **LABEL SENT**
- **Label sent to customer**
- a short explanation that the next operational event is delivery/receipt;
- **RETURN TO PURCHASING DASHBOARD**

This keeps the workflow boundary clear:

`Customer response → Send label → Await delivery → Item received → Inspection`

### Failure boundary

The confirmation is shown only for:

- Purchasing page context;
- inbound shipment (`Customer → GearCashOut`);
- successful shipping email.

If the shipment is saved but the customer email fails, the normal error state remains visible and staff are not told that the label was successfully sent.


## Completed inspection → customer final offer — 9 September 2026

When the Product Workbench successfully completes the final inspection and technical testing, and the linked customer purchase is awaiting its final offer:

1. the asset reaches **Ready for Resale**;
2. the inspection submit control changes to **INSPECTION COMPLETE**;
3. the next workflow action is **MAKE FINAL OFFER**;
4. the final-offer action opens the linked customer valuation in `admin-quote.html`;
5. staff can return to the Purchasing Dashboard while awaiting the customer/payment outcome;
6. the item must not be sent to Sales until the final offer is accepted and payment is completed.


## Purchasing pipeline count after Sales handover — 9 September 2026

A customer purchase can be commercially complete before its inventory asset is handed over. The Purchasing Dashboard may show it as completed until the actual handover occurs.

Once the linked `inventory_assets` record is **Sent to Sales** (or has `sent_to_sales_at`), that sale has left Purchasing and must be excluded from every Purchasing pipeline count and notice.

Authoritative route:

`sales.id → inventory_assets.source_sale_id → inventory_assets.status / sent_to_sales_at`

See the **Inventory Repair and Sales Workflow Diagnostic Roadmap** for the investigation path.


## Completed customer purchase page — payment-to-Sales handover

After staff confirm that payment has been sent, the completed purchase record is not another dashboard. The completion state presents only the two relevant choices:

1. **VIEW & SEND TO SALES** — opens the linked inventory record for the explicit Sales handover.
2. **RETURN TO PURCHASING DASHBOARD** — exits the completed transaction back to the main Purchasing Dashboard.

The old Sales Dashboard and Sales & Shipping navigation is intentionally removed from this completed-purchase page to avoid suggesting that payment completion itself has already moved the asset into Sales.

The handover route is:

`sales.id → inventory_assets.source_sale_id → inventory-detail.html?id=<asset>`

The asset must still be explicitly sent to Sales from Inventory.

## Viewing live sales listings from staff dashboards — 9 September 2026

Each active `resale_listings` record can now provide a direct staff-facing destination:

- **Website** — the URL is derived automatically from the WEBSITE outlet's configured `public_base_url` and the authoritative listing ID using `product.html?listing=<listing_id>`, unless an explicit listing URL is already stored.
- **External marketplaces** — staff paste the actual live marketplace URL into `resale_listings.listing_url`.
- **Active Sales / Listings** displays the relevant **VIEW ON WEBSITE** or **VIEW ON <CHANNEL>** action whenever a valid destination is available.

The authoritative relationship remains:

`inventory_assets → resale_listings → sales_outlets`

No duplicate stock record is created merely to support navigation.

**Current configuration note:** the live WEBSITE outlet currently has no `public_base_url`, so the automatic public website button will appear as soon as the actual retail storefront base URL is configured. The listing and public-detail backend already use the authoritative listing ID.

## TradeFlow shared mobile catalogue evidence — 5 November 2026

TradeFlow maintains its own shared catalogue in two independent Supabase environments:

- TEST: `nnsshnfkjcflucjrftzi`
- LIVE: `gxsrajtqzdjvmceqcpgv`

The shared mobile catalogue must be reconciled by stable business keys (manufacturer, model and package/storage), not by assuming UUIDs match. Product and evidence UUIDs are environment-specific. Tenant, customer, transaction, subscription, payment, domain, ownership and published website data must never be copied between environments.

### Verified mobile evidence batch 108

The 5 November batch added UK GBP used/refurbished evidence independently to both environments:

- TEST: 14 evidence records added.
- LIVE: 14 evidence records added, including the Samsung Galaxy S23 128GB evidence after its missing LIVE product package was created.
- LIVE also received the missing Google Pixel 10 128GB package and three matching UK evidence records from the verified TEST shared catalogue.
- LIVE received the missing Samsung Galaxy S23 128GB package.
- The hidden Apple iPhone 18 seed and retired invalid Google Pixel 11 128GB package were deliberately not copied.

After reconciliation, the active customer-visible Mobile Phones product keys matched: 156 in TEST and 156 in LIVE. The remaining total-row difference is explained by hidden/retired audit records, not a visible catalogue gap.

### Evidence rules

- UK evidence is recorded as `uk_new` or `uk_used`, with GBP currency, exact package, condition, source URL, observation date and availability.
- Refurbished offers remain `uk_used` evidence with the seller's grade retained in `item_condition`.
- Opened/never-used and sealed sold observations remain distinct from ordinary used evidence.
- Do not infer stock from stale delivery dates, RAM from storage alone, or a package from an adjacent model.
- Use `source_name` + `source_record_key` as the idempotency key; do not duplicate the same retailer/listing observation.
- Comparison-site snapshots are leads, not additional seller observations.
- No overseas evidence, contract totals or new retail offers may be placed in UK-used evidence.

This batch changed catalogue data only. No application code, schema, valuation rules, RLS, Edge Functions, Stripe, tenant/customer data or Worker deployments were changed.


## TradeFlow mobile catalogue batch 109 — 5 November 2026

Three additional UK used/refurbished observations were added for the exact Samsung Galaxy A57 5G 128GB package in both TEST and LIVE:

- refurbed UK: £272 Premium refurbished, exact 8GB/128GB Dual-SIM Awesome Gray; UK domestic dispatch, 12-month seller warranty and 30-day returns.
- Cash Converters Levenshulme: £269.99, Good/previous-use, unlocked 128GB Grey, 12-month warranty. The page's accessory wording conflicts; do not use accessory inclusion in valuation.
- Cash Converters Lewisham: £299.99, very minor cosmetic wear, unlocked 128GB Blue, 12-month warranty.

All three are separate seller offers with their own stable source record keys. They were inserted independently in both environments. Product business keys remain aligned at 156 active customer-visible mobile packages in TEST and LIVE. Post-write totals: TEST 160 products / 574 evidence (558 active); LIVE 158 products / 568 evidence (555 active). The two extra TEST product rows remain hidden/retired audit records, not customer-visible catalogue differences.

The same 3 used-evidence gaps remain intentionally open in both environments:
- Motorola Edge 70 Plus 256GB — no credible exact UK used/refurb offer found; available MSE offers are new retail only.
- OPPO Reno16 F 5G 256GB — eBay refurbished result currently advertises free international postage; UK dispatch is not verified, so excluded.
- OPPO Find X10 Pro Max 512GB — surfaced exact UK listings are new/sealed, not used; overseas/international results excluded.

No fabricated evidence was inserted for those gaps.


## TradeFlow mobile catalogue batch 110 — 5 November 2026

Five UK refurbished retail offers were added independently in TEST and LIVE for Apple iPhone 13 128GB:
- giffgaff £209 Good, 128GB Midnight, in stock, 12-month warranty.
- The Big Phone Store £199.99 Good, 128GB Midnight, in stock, minimum 85% battery health.
- Reboxed £189 Good, 128GB Midnight, standard battery, 70-point TechCheck, minimum 80% battery, 12-month warranty and 30-day returns; preparing/refurbishment 4–6 days, last one at this price, checkout fee may apply.
- Furbishmarket £191.99 Good, 128GB Starlight unlocked, 10 in stock, minimum 85% battery, 12-month warranty and free UK delivery.
- Tech Market £199.99 Good, 128GB Midnight; listed on UK retailer homepage, stock quantity not confirmed, one-year warranty and 30-day returns advertised.

TEST and LIVE each now have six active UK-used evidence records for iPhone 13 128GB. Post-write mobile totals: TEST 160 products (159 active / 156 active visible), 579 evidence (563 active); LIVE 158 products (158 active / 156 active visible), 573 evidence (560 active). Active customer-visible mobile product keys remain aligned 156/156, with no missing keys in either direction.

Three exact used-evidence gaps remain in both environments: Motorola Edge 70 Plus 256GB, OPPO Find X10 Pro Max 512GB and OPPO Reno16 F 5G 256GB. No evidence was inserted for these because current results did not meet exact UK used/refurbished seller/dispatch/condition checks.
